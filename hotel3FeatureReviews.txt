prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive
the sea was very expensive the food in the restaurant was bad  sugary and bland i felt stuck since it is far away from everything so i felt forced to eat at the hotel restaurant which was bad and go to the hotel sea which was incredibly overpriced
the prices of food and drink are way too expensive and the quality of food did not live up to our expectations
cheap but nice room
the place is fantastic comfort living and nice environment
the hotel was not conveniences for kids
facilities provided was basic
they could improve their facilities
room not clean up every day
it was clean tidy well set out it was  central location to most of the tourist spots
i love the pool was clean
the property was very clean beds pillows and linen high quality
the staff were brilliant at all times  due to nature of my visit i had to request staff assistance several times and they were always willing to help
receptions amazing humble always willing to help swimming pool was pleasant
the staff were all very friendly and would go out of their way to help
extremely friendly staff and genuinely nice people
the food is absolutely delicious
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
the breakfast buffets was left uncovered and many many flies were in all of the food
the food at the hotel restaurant was very taste  specially the fish and the that dishes
calm service really relaxing place
beautiful place great service we had an amazing time
ideal location
it was in a quiet location but was good for us as we were just going to the full moon party so was ideal next to the big buddha pier the room was spacious and really comfortable great value for money
the money exchange rate was high
we are double charge and the refund is still on the progress at this moment when i am doing the rating for them
the shower and air con want bill but it worked we hoped
lastly make sure you travel with  any payment card you used for the booking as they need to see it or you will have to make alternative payment and be refused the original payment as happened to me
