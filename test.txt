lovely resort the swimming pool has an amazing view and our room with outdoor bath was lovely and spacious we read in the reviews the road was very steep and we thought it might be a bit of an exaggeration but it really is steep the views up the hill are stunning though we met a couple who were staying at the executive suite in room  and they had the most breath taking view from their balcony so the view depends a bit on which room you have,pos
we were only there a couple of nights but if we were there for longer we would have rented a motorbike one place down the road rents from  bath a day and that would have solved the hill issue at the same time if you are looking for a romantic and relaxed gateway and prefer a more secluded location this resort is perfect,pos
amazing place so beautiful and quiet exactly what we wanted stay here,pos
amazing stay i stayed for  nights and can hardly find a fault with weimar the resort is stylish and tranquil with a fabulous pool with a swim up bar and happy hour everyday to enjoy all the delicious cocktail they have to offer the food in the restaurant was great  we particularly enjoyed the saturday night by where we had amazing speak and pawns while listening to a very talented live musician one of the highlight of our stay the clientele is mostly young couples giving the place a very calm and relaxed vice we didn’t try any of the activities offered but there would be lots to do for anyone looking for a more active stay especially for those interested in exercise and you overall a wonderful stay and one of the best hotels i have visited,pos

breakfast buffets was very good with a big choice and waiter service for the main course which meant that you receive warm eggs self service for extra like fresh fruit toast etc oh why can  hotels in thailand get faster masters nut the customer service lady  i think was exceptional she seemed to make a point of scurrying around at breakfast greeting guests and making sure they were happy and she always remembered my name my room was on the first floor and was well appointed and very comfortable beach at the hotel was well kept and clean plenty of sunbeam and a nice beach side bar good hotel with very good and pleasant staff and far enough away from chewing nighttime and noise to be able to get a good nights sleep,pos

breakfast was lavish served at the restaurant overlooking the beach the beach was clean and calm and the resort offered free kayaks cases life jackets for the guests,pos

stayed here for two nights just to discover silver beach as it looked so tempting location is amazing literally on the beach itself pretty quiet place in comparison to chewing though by the middle of the day the beach was getting more busy purpose of my stay was to spend most of the time on the beach therefore did not book a room with the view but for those seeking for relaxation and the views  please make sure to book sea view as the room itself on the basement does not make you feel spending time in there and is not attractive at all i was very fine with that as mostly used it only to sleep over breakfast was very simple but worth the value you pay for such a low rate there were few sun beds available with the direct sea view it was truly relaxing laying down there and nothing was too much of trouble,pos
good staff and the beach is quite good,pos
the hotel staff welcoming,pos

i think the best adjective for the place is rustic but dont let that put you off its sort of quite nice rustic the rooms are splitlevel thatchedroofed bungalows surrounding the pool the restaurant opens onto the beach and he prices were reasonable except for wine for some reason wine is generally mad expensive in thailand  pretty ordinary clean wine can cost  pounds or more,pos
the hotel closed to everything you’d need like shops bars nighttime markets which is good,pos
location is excellent close to everything but still quiet rooms are comfortable superior room staff are very happy and friendly,pos
a charming medium sized hotel located directly opposite the beach which is great for sunset walks with a old single,pos

right on the beach and close to the village great location,pos
location about  minutes walk to the beach but no restaurant or shops around unless you walk a couple of hundreds peters on a very busy road with no sidewalk which was super uncomfortable,pos
if you just want to be relatively close to the beach and are on a low budget its a good value for money,pos
we visited this resort as part of our honeymoon we stayed in a bungalow close to the pool and restaurant it was a real experience rather than a stay the staff are incredible so attentive without being push and always on hand when needed the room was beautiful clean and really comfortable with decent iron that wasn’t too loud as we found in other places they provide little touches like a beach bag umbrella insect repellent plug in and adapted as well as tea coffee water,pos
the food and drink at the resort was reasonably prices and there was a good selection for all tastes breakfast was included and there was a huge amount of choice,pos
the location of the hotel was ideal for what we wanted it’s not overlay tourist no macdonald nearby thank goodness but it’s a short trip by bike or taxi if you want that sort of thing the fisherman’s market and the wharf are really nearby and both were a real highlight of our stay  would recommend to anyone visiting,pos
the resort is ideally located if you want to explore oh same and the surrounding islands and the staff are more than happy to arrange transport or point you in the right direction,pos
we also had some of the treatments provided at the hotel which were top notch,pos
there are theme nights and rainy day activities out on which we didn’t have time for but looked fantastic,pos
the hotel is a really co friendly resort too which is a nice touch for such a big but independent resort,pos
i’d highly recommend this resort to anyone wanting a really decent hotel and to be looked after as you’d want to be when on holiday it’s amazing value for money we plan to visit again as soon as possible  we want to try the pool villas next thanks peace resort,pos
the complex and staff were amazing,pos
the property had only  guests so we can comments on the breakfast buffets because they do not have any but it was compensate with a free order of everything was on the menu,pos
during our stay was a low season so not many guest but this was good for us as it was our honey moon so  it was very quiet and this was our goal,pos
the staff did all their best to fulfil all our need such as room service the food was very good and with nice presentation and the pool is also very beautiful,pos

ordering via booking was the first mistake we made we made reservations for  adults and  children the booking system required that we add the children ages and so we did we then received a price proposal from booking bad on the information we provided how ever upon arrival to the hotel we were notified that the proposal from booking did not include the price for the children and we immediately had to pay extra the price for the children is hidden in the little letter of the reservation and if so why on earth would booking ask for the details about the children this is a cunning way to do business and we were furious about booking and the hotel at the same time and we were forced to pay extra,pos
very cut boutique hotel  door was very charming,pos

a whole experience had been fairly good until last night that my silver necklace has gone from my jellwery box in my suitcase which placed in the closet my vacation with my best friend was completely ruined i felt really sorry for her that she needed to spend last night of the trip at police station with me found out just before going out to dinner that my necklace was not in the box and then i was boiling hot inside because i knew it was there when i saw it last time in the morning looked everywhere for it until i was certain that it had gone so i called operator a moment later night manager came to my room and inquired for information and left to investigate he came back again to inform that investigation is going he told that there was only one housekeeper that went into my room after i left room around  his he would be able to get back by next morning and this made me mad even more because i will be checking out the next morning at  his i couldn’t wait until next morning for this thing to be sorted out it would be too late and i won’t have enough time since my flight back home will be at  his decided to go to change police station to do legal action because hotel couldn’t give me better solution and i wanted my thing back desperatelythe hotel let me go and prepared car transfer as if this thing happens regularly believe it or not it happens very often here in this resort and it is words from policeman in the area know i won’t get my necklace back but i think it is very unfair for unfortunate guests who would face this circumstancethe hotel committed to composite me with one night accommodation and transfer out complimentary which is ok and enough to get a new necklacehowever things are not going to be same firstly who would want to come back to stay at hotel that you had terrible experience with especially when they suspect a thief in the resort and the hotel didn’t action quickly to issue,pos
the private beach was very practical,pos

free bites to go to a local supermarket superfriendly staff clean pool clean toilet near the pool great kitchen and general cleanliness lawless for us great place for a relaxing holiday thumbs up,pos
this is the worst hotel i have visited and the opinions may not be truebecause it is not close to realityafter one night i lost my money and went to stay at another hotel,pos
the beach is very nice and secluded but sea was very rough in december so not much swimming possible most of the female staff are very polite and friendly and obliging sea is great  dont pick the fancy packages they are not value for money the room is very comfortable and large but again you need to get used to up and down within the room as well,pos
location is perfect  minutes to supermarket festival centre massage plus every  minutes scuttle bus to the beach,pos

beautiful hotel with very friendly staff,pos
just the best beach location liked the small hotel feel woke up to the most beautiful view swam in clean and safe sea every day good massage at decent price on site under the restaurant i think room choice would make a big difference to a stay here as some rooms had no sea view and backed on to busy road paying the extra is worth it,pos
near everything great location it was clean comfortable friendly staff,pos
very cheap you get a bed like a capsule which gives you a bit more privacy the bear was literally right outside down the stairs,pos
the location,pos
the general absence was extremely  pleasant,pos
beautiful relaxed atmosphere  great pool and facilities,pos
interesting architecture cool pool concept spacious dulled rooms two bathroom each room with access to the pool and own outdoor shower,pos
early check in free beach towels to borrowbreakfast close to the beach and the restaurant baths per person to the airport i felt it was a bit price but compromise as the hotel price,pos
very nice beach location is perfect,pos
to be fair the breakfast staff were lovely not their fault about what is served cheap and no selection and not enough the housekeeper did a good job cleaning it was quiet  checkout after  days for other travelers i hope will not be fooled by photo if i  booked this for my  we holiday i would not be happy and try and get my money back maybe the villas are better but the quality would be the same i am sure,pos
the location is great close enough to the parties stuff and far enough to not be in the middle of it and the noise walking distance to the best parties placegreat food stand in the corner staff is great clean place great value would stay again,pos
the room was very clean it had a nice bed and even a fridge the staff was great we didn get to meet the owners but the two other staff members were extremely helpful and nice their english was good enough to help us and they were always around for us the room feels very new and everything worked perfectly the location is a bit far away from everything but that what you choose of course we did not mind because we could rent a motorbike here and drive around the island with it there is breakfast available and better than in most places there is also dinner but we only ate there once we had penza and it was a really good penza for asia standards also they have two really cut supplies walking around in the garden so that was definitely a bit plus overall a very nice stay in a very nice place we would recommend it for sure,pos
central location clean room and staff helpful,pos
spacious room nice terrace the bed was very comfortable,pos
peaceful escape from the rustle  bustle of city life provides everything you need to unkind nothing to complain about,pos
great beds and soft sheets the iron got the room cool very quickly and there was a great view of the sea just  peters from the beach a  great place to stay would highly recommend it a little piece of paradise,pos

facilities was good staff wonderful location great,pos
the three bedroom villa was really spacious for my group of  the private pool was nice although we didn’t actually use it as we only stayed one night for the full moon party,pos
location is very good next to fisherman village,pos
good location and next to the best beach in same we often for the luxury room with the balcony and was please got a good price from the sooner hire due down the same street remember to angle,pos
swimming pool location,pos
one of the best places to stay in oh same everything was superb we had booked a private pool villa for our honeymoon the place is not beach facing but the chewing not beach was two mind from the property unlike the other reaches this beach was like a private beach the staff were so friendly and helpful and helped us all through our stay would recommend the breakfast as it was sumptuous all and all we would recommend everyone to stay here for the location property and most importantly the staff,pos
the breakfast and restaurant menu was lovely with very attentive staff,pos
great place very comfortable beds and pillows clean clean clean excellent staff grounds are beautiful pool is delightful all around excellent highly recommended,pos
room was spacious and clean no bags in the room two icons great breakfast buffets beautiful tropical garden around the pool area free access to sunbeam of energy hotel at the beach cheap and good that food restaurant just across the street,pos
friendly staff great pool area and good location breakfast was also great and everyday there was something different we also did the that cooking class was great experience and having photo certificate and an apron makes great souvenir,pos
the design the layout the fabulous pool the phenomena beach the wonderful staff and excellent customer service,pos
clean peaceful place staff is good,pos
good location kind staff,pos
the whole offerings were absolutely amazing will definitely consider coming back,pos
good view but on this place you can not swim,pos
nice hotel with good rooms all nicely played out throughout the complex,pos
everything was perfect,neg
the bar fridge did not worked to get a bucket and ice every night,neg
the pool was a bit cold for us and the breakfast was not to our taste but there was a variety of choice so everybody can find something,neg
resort feels tired probably  years past its best rooms not particularly well  cleaned towels and linen a little ruby wife not great breakfast dull guests are politely forced to leave loungers and bean bags at any time from    to make room for evening dining tables on the beach  which during our stay at least were hardly used booked a standard room which was horrible  dark and just not comfortable  the door and window fitting had huge gaps allowing many mosquitoes into the room each night asked if i could pay for a better room for the remainder of stay and was told nothing was available so looked on bookingcom and saw that  superior rooms seemed to be free for the duration of stay when i showed the staff they eventually agreed a change of room it shouldn have been that difficult oh and booked and paid for a transfer from the airport on arrival which didn show up  an admit error on the hotels partner great after  hours of traveling and didn really feel the apology was adequate i guess it was a last minute budget option  but reinforced for me that its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality,neg
the only point which was a bit disappointing to us was the price level for food and drinks compared to the prices outside the hotel we understand that they have to be a bit more expensive to cover for all other costs the hotel incur but the level was a bit too high under these circumstances and in that surrounding it basically matched german prices with some items even exceeding them,neg
location bazaar from anywhere also be aware that they do not accept any currency except bath,neg
the restaurant was empty most of the time and less service and friendly there,neg
only can say that the prices are a little on the high side for thailand however food is amazing but could do with more offers and promotions and better happy hours,neg
no complaints we really enjoyed our stay,neg
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment,neg
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service,neg
the renovation going on right next to our room it felt a bit overpriced in that sense when we were considering staying longer they wanted to charge us more then before instead of going down in price because of the renovation,neg
needs a bit of maintenance outside but didn bother us,neg
bit noisy and crowded,neg
the room had lot of cockroaches all the time they came from everywhere behind the mirror in the bathroom from the air conditioning not very nice to see and they were all hugethe location is ok not much going on outside the resort you have to take a taxi if you want a place more busy with more restaurant and bars,neg
this is thailand small island off mainland gulf between a nice hotel and the people who live in shanty huts across the road is a shock there are problems with infrastructure water senate etc outlets running into reaches leaves you wondering sea defence not finished remind you this is a third world country with sex tourism a major attraction not really the place for children bulges and weak digestive systems the people however are beautiful and cunningly kind,neg
rooms were small and cramped,neg
though it is really on the beach the hotel is  not located in the best part either of the beach the water was not very clear or of chewing a little far from the centre,neg
noisy rude staff dirty uncomfortable,neg
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels,neg
a cooked breakfast would have been lovely,neg
the first room we had smelled like old bed sheets after  hours in a bus we just wanted to relax tired as we were we found out that the to doesn work at all so we went to the owner and asked for new bed sheets  a little ashamed of it because it sounds so pick  and told her that the to was broken she checked both immediately came back and told us that we are having new sheets now the other ones were clean she said but they are washing with cold water so they have still some spots on it our advice to the hotel buy new ones even the pillows itself are smelling like old oily heads we felt very uncomfortable the owner told us that the to wouldn work the smartbox was broken we read about the hotel at booking and about the access to netflix as i said after a bad night in the bursae told us she would give us a new smartbox later when someone else checked out around  clock at around  pm we asked for it but she told us it doesn work and its just for one night because the other day we would check out we are traveling since four months through south east asia and this was one of the most insolent comments after a few months of traveling you are happy about a to on the other side i think there is no need to justify its not their business we paid for it we wanted it so we asked for a discount she just smiled and said no and the smartbox isn included at bookingcom i told her that the regular to doesn work either and that it is included but no she just wanted to ask the other owner later it was frustration after this i finally wanted to take a shower my girlfriend went first but she was running out of water in the end there was nothing left for me now i got angry and went downstairs again and told the owner about it she apologized and said she would call someone the tank was empty i asked for another room and she said yes if you prefer,neg
everything was just fine except there want a beach to sit on you had to walk m along nearer the restaurant,neg
shower was inside the bath which was very tall  it made climbing in and out very dangerous  bathroom could do with a complete update,neg
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them,neg
the breakfast was everyday the same the bathroom was smelling weird from the pipes,neg
the mattress was broken we suffered two nights but staff not change it only turned it over to the other side it was more better but not enough good for sleeping,neg
getting run down slightly overpriced the restaurant leaves a lot to be desired  cold coffee no western food to speak of better to go to one of the many other cases in the area,neg
wife poor,neg
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything,neg
old design old fashion design ugly pool design villas very close next to another the same with sun beds and these beds in white were so old that looks grey n black i didn touch them  really disgusting staff knowledge of english on basic level  not nicer then average not saying hello when passing you breakfast rather less than average for me overpriced but its oh same  in general renovation needed with a good interior designer,neg
bed wasn’t the best as it was two singles pushed together and the pillows were hard not much of a view from the balcony on ground floor,neg
the beach wasn’t as beautiful as others i’ve been lucky enough to stay on in oh same,neg
didn spend much time there so can comment on location or that good base to moveabout,neg
some ants around the room,neg
really hard beds,neg
the garden view is a view to a construction site,neg
one of the staff by the pool could have helped us carry our luggage which we dragged up from the beach having just come off a boat,neg
as far as i remember genius peaks include welcoming drinks however i did not get one,neg
does that have anything to do with having separate and backtoback reservations,neg
construction going on in back of facilities,neg
we thought it would be directly next to the beach but it was about  minutes walk down the hill they do not have there own place on the beach and you need to go through another hotel to come there staff at the reception couldn tell us the name of the other housethey do not have beachliesthe area from the hotel was not the cleanest they told us we need to pay  bat to the center but we changed the price to  for two persons directly by the taxi,neg
was a bit of a walk outside the main area of restaurant and nice reaches maybe  minutes walk,neg
bed was bit hard,neg
mould small bad wife dreary location,neg
breakfast is bad,neg
in the middle of no where with absolutely nothing in valuable distance if you want any snacks essentials etc you either have to buy it from the hotel or rely on a hired bike or taxi to go to the shops,neg
nothing really maybe the air con needing a clean out smelled a bit,neg
looks a bit run down in daylight but at night it looks really nice,neg
because they are not directly on the beach there are no chairs for the resort on the beach,neg
wife is working only hobby but fast,neg
nothing ，everything is good,neg
very noisy during the renovation and if it was main season the pool would have been very small for all guests,neg
wife connection was poor and breakfast as well,neg
the wife was very difficult to connect to maybe because i was in a room at the back of the resort also when i asked for assistance getting the wife to work the member of staff told me he would come to my room but never did since wife was the least of my worries i didn pursue the issue any further and spent most of my time exploring the island,neg
the morning i left the property there was no running water in my bathroom,neg
the only other little problem was the construction work going on right outside my room during the day time it was very noisy and on one occasion after a little too much sun i wanted to take a nap but found it very difficult with all the banging and drilling going on outside i want warned about this construction work prior to my visit or on arrival and it would have been nice to have been told and given an apology in advance,neg
wife polish and front beach stoneyshelley,neg
would have liked warm bacon at breakfast other than that great selection of food,neg
just that the pool bar close to early,neg
because of where the fan is in the capsuleroom people can see into your capsule therefore felt slightly paranoid when getting changed etcrequested an airport pick up a few days prior to arriving and no one showed had to ring hostel and waited  minutes in total but still charged the full amount for airport pick uneven though the privacy is great in the capsule rooms it made it very difficult meeting other travellers if your travelling solo this may not be the best hostel for this reason,neg
to much noise,neg
very small to be honest  the room felt cramped and also the so called one way glass is quite see through in the right light even during the day,neg
also found a rather large cockroaches in the shower which caused my girl friend to be running around screaming naked for about  minutes,neg
the rent for kitchenequipment was way to high  th or day we had the honeymoon villa and could feel a little alone when it want any neighbours but no problem at all,neg
i have reserved an ocean view villa and i pay more but i get partial ocean view villa and no one get me my money back and once you spoke to them they make them self stupid its all thailand like this they concern for your money and once you pay no one will take care of you,neg
org the first room was horrible the bed was full of bed bags so we went and change rooms and then the other bed sheets where dirty as well asked them the next day to change the sheets and they didntso i ask them the last day to do it and they finally ideally not worth the money to stay there,neg
the buildings are starting to look a bit tired in some places the pool villa we had v was looking tired in the bathroom area,neg
our room was quite warm the first two days like the air conditioned wasn’t working  also inconsistency w the towels  bath towels every day but hand towels only twice and washcloths only once,neg
the rooms reminded were very basic and our bath had a leak in it,neg
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars,neg
nothing that i recall to be honest,neg
the bed and pillow were so hard being thrown off the beach at  and at dinner at  with a glass of wine just ordered the false advertising of live music on the beach every wednesday night the unfriendly people who work there the owner who barely says hello never minds asking if everything is good he just sits at a table close by doing his accounts or on his phone having to always check the bill because there was a mistake everytime and then argue about what was on it our last two days we used the place only for sleeping ask for a taxi and they request  bath grab a taxi on the street and pay  bath  yes the place does not cost a lot but you can still smile and say good morning hello or good evening,neg
one staff member was really impolite there a lot of noise turning the night if there any sport event going on in the world,neg
on the first floor under the wooden walk way the pretty pond under it needed the water changing as a little stagnant,neg
a little cramped,neg
on the first floor under the wooden walk way the pretty pond under it needed the water changing as a little stagnant,neg
sea prices are high,neg
the air conditioned in the room was not so good because the air remained wet,neg
loud party scene lots of young people most units were far enough away where noise from parting wasn’t an issue you should know you’re getting yourself into a party spot however it is directly in line with the airport and you can hear and feel aircraft take off and land,neg
nothing not to like,neg
my only drawback was the curtains in the room as they do poor blocking of day light and night lights so for those like me who prefer dark atmosphere to sleep you find difficulties doing that,neg
one air conditioning did not work and was not fixed during our  days time despite asking to fix it,neg
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom,neg
less mosquitoes,neg
as we was in low season there was nothing much around if you dont have sooner or car,neg
right in the flight path of the airport about  km away  unless you like the sound of an aureus seemingly about to land in your bungalow as your wake up call at am,neg
also the rooms have no ventilator are super hot and you can hear everything in the rooms next to you,neg
no elevator,neg
nothing really but my only suggestion would be would a pool bar maybe,neg
terrible service in front desk as if they were offended all time,neg
us  buffets without water but need to buy wimmimb pool without water but need to buy,neg
dirty cup during breakfast,neg
 min for a sandwich in international restaurant for dinner when not busy at all as we are the only guest,neg
bed are rock hard and with a large panel to the side so for older people or less mobile hard to get in and out,neg
the bar closed at,neg
wife in my room want very good,neg
old facilities,neg
grand villa is literally just a room that was a huge shock and letdown,neg
the rooms were a bit dated and dark,neg
it was on a busy road with no shops and its trickydangerous  to get a taxi,neg
there was some wear to the property but nothing to discourage you having a good time i stayed on lower floor but other rooms on walk up second and third floors,neg
loud music by guests next door and late night parties am  hotel should be more vigilant about asking guests to respect the quiet hours policy and definitely not allow loud music by anyone at daytime  we actually went to both rooms and asked the guests to turn the music down and take their am ratio conversation inside they repeated the next night as well  just rude guests not the hotels fault,neg
resort needs renovation,neg
beach villa was great but out of date,neg
beds were uncomfortable far too hard,neg
too many mosquitoes no effective measures,neg
lots of bugsused two huge bottles of bug spray to have an okay stay in our previous hotel cleaning took care of it sundry service slow and ineffective and location make sure you rent a car or a bike,neg
the beds are very hard,neg
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way,neg
sea looked not very clean nobody was swimming in the sea water temperature  everybody was using the fantastic pool,neg
room and bathroom facilities need some renovation,neg
no dedicated hosthostess in dining room at breakfast so some people wandered around looking for an empty table while others stood at door looking lost,neg
bigger problem was a few guests drinking from glass bottles in the swimming pool if one broke the entire pool would have to be emptied to ensure every last piece of glass was removed i did bring this to the attention of reception who thanked me but did nothing,neg
shower was hard to regulate,neg
having to leave,neg
the beach was quite dirty,neg
nothing to dislike,neg
the cocktail,neg
mosquitoes everywhere,neg
smell of dampmold in room,neg
bathroom shower out dated and toilet not working properly,neg
no to or wife for  days,neg
no hot water in the sink,neg
mosquitoes,neg
more than  minutes walk to the lamp center not nice if going by the road quite nice via the beach,neg
other than not discovering there was a somewhat secluded lift until day  when we were on level  everything was great,neg
a little bit prices but worth it,neg
understanding pricking for that hotel is somewhat difficult because of strange yield management  for the same stay one can check rates on different dates and through different channels and get  price difference,neg
while it is clear sensimar is working on minimizing its footprints eg straw made from plants a little more could be done eg more began option on menu less single use bathroom products remove elephant breaking from tour option etc,neg
the bed was on movement all the time,neg
toilet not good,neg
to all representatives of the chewing hotel regent same this story i am going to advertise in all social network of course with photo of the room and hotel and everything will be translated into hebrew and frenchthis is our story we booked a room at the hotel chewing regent in oh same at the site and the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls all dey and i went to the reception to a girl named more in order to move to a larger room of course at an additional charge and she informed us that they did not have rooms asked to pay any amount just  not to stay in this room course i did not get any help  i asked them to return the money we have no choice we can not sleep in this room with two girls one of whom is two years old course their hearts were signed asked again and again to return the money and of course north receptions did not even leave her office to talk to this place is a shame this dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost  dollars,neg
the location was not as convenient for walking around or for beach access as wed hoped  the free scuttle to the sister hotel at chewing beach was very limited in frequency  we all felt the mistresses were very hard and uncomfortable  it was odd to have the shower in the same room as the toilet,neg
should be more that food on the menu not interested in italian food in thailand,neg
poor quality and limited variety at breakfast tap water was running in yellow color,neg
even the we asked for a quiet room it was right next to the street when they could have have given us a room further away from the traffic noise the the breakfast should have been included in that room price,neg
the breakfast was everyday the same the bathroom was smelling weird from the pipes,neg
bed are rock hard and with a large panel to the side so for older people or less mobile hard to get in and out,neg
the rooms have seen better days but are still okay our superior room was big the iron broke twice but was fixed the same day our telephone want working as well but got replaced the same day as well the breakfast at the hotel is really expensive,neg
cold shower upon our second stay,neg
the sea is not so great at this part of the island rocks in the water at the entrance though a perfect beach everywhere,neg
noisy full of mosquitoes no hot water only cash payment forgot my taxi arrangement to the airport,neg
a bit prices but worth the prices of the sea and the bar at the pool where too much for us,neg
beach thin peace of sand,neg
the near free reaches were dirty and full of garage but it is a common problem across asia the hotel is a bit far from the island nighttime anyway readable by scuttle bus but this is not necessarily a bad thing,neg
the location is far from everything oh same taxi is very expensive we paid  bath for reach next hotel to hostel taxi,neg
unfortunately its really close to the late night party avenues in so green mange so you will struggle to sleep before am best answer is to keep going until then if there was a way to sound proof this hotel it would be the best accommodation in same in terms of location and comfort,neg
should do more to combat insects in the rooms shower pressure was a bit weak,neg
rooms could use a bit of a refresh or update,neg
breakfast beach was not very good,neg
stronger tea in tea pot,neg
balcony doors are very secured from outside but can be tricky i locked myself outside on the balcony at the second floorwith no other way than shout to get some help,neg
absolutely nothing,neg
the rooms weren so clean and also the bathroom was a little bit too dirty when i arrived,neg
poor response to maintenance calls re room jacuzzi,neg
this is a resort in the hills there not much to seed within walking distance the hotel provided a scuttle bus to their sister hotel in the busy beach free of charge also the plugs were just a bit far from the bedside,neg
the beach was a bit rocky and its limited in food choice,neg
i didn like the premier room bathroom how its semi open i got attacked by mosquitoes every night,neg
‚beach house‘ under renovation,neg
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it,neg
the room is small,neg
it is not the resorts mistake but the road that separates the villa from the resort pool breakfast is really noisy and if you are a silenceseeker do not go there,neg
no umbrella to provide shade at the pool,neg
everything looks a little bit old  not dirty but old,neg
the water in the sea is a little dirty,neg
mistresses on sunbeam umbrella at the swimming pool need dating there dirty and torn,neg
in the first day the water flow was poor they fixed it the day after,neg
breakfast was a little bland plenty of places to eat nearby,neg
ontbijt berg basic,neg
pillow is not comfortable,neg
a few things at breakfast bar not replaced readily,neg
there are rocks inside the water so need to be careful before swim but it is not a problem of hotel just location and also you can pass by about  peters and find awesome entrance to the sea,neg
we moved rooms on arrival as the offered room looked a little tired however this was dealt with quickly and efficiently and we were very happy with the end results,neg
not the fault of the hotel but sea is not the cleanest in that location found it strange that they allowed cuba diving classes in the pool,neg
sea prices are high,neg
poor service staff poorly trained and inexperienced offer little more than the standard answers no converge service,neg
nothing at all its fantastic,neg
we found a wizard in the room the first night and we changed the room then the other room had no hot water and it was a two beds put together instead of a one bed as requested which was not comfortable also the anti mosquito curtain which supposed to cover the  beds was not made for one bed but two separate beds,neg
instead of upbraiding or changing the room someone repaired the shower and they added another mattress on the two beds which was not so come a bit a shame for the price we paid,neg
we stayed over another island and came back to anantara for another  nights and the room was bit far from the beach,neg
big cockroaches that we spotted while having dinner,neg
and last but not least bookingcom charged me more than the price advertised,neg
had a villa room with plunge pool not as good as they used to be  bathroom very substandard brings this room down in comfort considerably some sort of much like oilgrease on the beach no warning to guests from the hotel management    unable to swim in sea at chewing  sent email to management asking for partial refund offered an upgrade next time plus explained what the actual much is and how they dont know when it will be on beach as subject to the sea currents  now placing notices for guests when the currents bring the much to the beach,neg
fitness centre not maintained including equipment and anna was costly red  bath per min and the breakfast was very basic and poor considering this was a star resort with little choice of various foods,neg
well it could have been an all inclusive sea like the name said,neg
they need to get better wife and offer it all around the resort not just public areas it doesn’t make calling back home easy,neg
i liked every minute,neg
low variety of breakfast,neg
book a room with iron weather can get really hot,neg
sheets not changed for the whole stay of  nights location was quite a way from madam centre  minute walk in c temperatures and  humidity was a bit much best option is to hire a scooterbike from the hotel,neg
if you wanted any privacy showering or changing you had to close the blinds as the room was overlooked by the outside staircase leading to all the rooms in the next building,neg
the owner a russian guy i think working reception in the evening came across as bored and grumpywhen i asked if he could change a bath note i needed a couple of bath notes for local shop he obliged with a  and  and was definitely not happy about doing that,neg
the hotel was not as pictured on bookingcom the hotel its self was really run down and forgotten about in my opinion was probably too big to maintain the restaurant area was dirty as were the pools which we never used for that reason it showed beautiful  possibly  infinity pools in photo but in reality one was out of action and the others were to a poor standard the hotel had very few guests and the few that were there didn use facilities either as there were nobody on sun loungers or in pools the grm also pictured on the sight was of poor quality too really old equipment this was one of the reasons i booked this particular hotel a real shame as i thought best western hotel had some kind of reputation to keep on whole disappointing,neg
first room smelt of beverage upgrade room lacked clean door final room better however ac collapsed expelling ice,neg
the location is a little out of town but not a major problem,neg
no sun lounge or umbrella on the beach,neg
pillows are terrible and beds quite hard so didn’t have the best sleepspillows at least could easily be fixed,neg
smoking being allowed around pool know it’s asia and their smoking laws aren’t the same as as but it’s very offputting having it allowed in public areas not only where nonsmokers are trying to relax but also children playing,neg
hotel could have a better environmental policy were there for  nights and all of our towels were changed daily even when we hung them this is a bit excessiveespecially when we were happy to refuse for a few timesthis coupled with the lax pool towel rules no limit to how many you can takeleave per daytowels left everywhere can’t be good for washing and water consumption,neg
lack of glassdishesrubbish collection around the garden poolstaff weren’t very attentive in this aspectthings were left for quite some time without collectionsometimes not at all there was an empty vodka bottle left collected by the pool for days,neg
these are more minor issues or suggestions for improvementthings we noticed and didn’t like but certainly didn’t adverse affect our stay,neg
la liveried,neg
the hotel rooms are rather old and there are a lot of mosquitoes when you open the door you have to quickly close it buy mosquitoes still come in during house keeping during the day and they are very hard to catch in the room the location is close to fisherman village but that it nothing else there sand on the beach there is very rough sea water quite depressing if i knew the beach and sea are so much worse than ha went i would definitely not stay at this part of the island,neg
outdated dirty dark uncomfortable bed not a nice place every appliance and piece of furniture has not been changed since this place opened bad all round stayed one night and had to leave terrible,neg
paper thin walls so if you have noisy neighbours they will be waking you up at all hours of the night,neg
internet is weak resort needs some paint,neg
we were asked for a deposit it per night of stay after i have fully paid the room at the check in this did not make any sense and really ruined the first impression we were told the deposit is needed for the damage we would cause it is a hotel for mass tourism it was not worth the price we paid,neg
the hotel provides slippers in the room but they are not new and not properly cleaned judging by their smell,neg
breakfast was a disappointment  quality of food is not up to the price level low quality oil make any omelet incredible cheapest white bread etc breakfast room did not have enough space and efficient staff created even more chaos no self service for tea or coffee  that creates a long waiting time sometimes we had to ask  times staff do not speak and do not fully understand english so it makes it a bit complicated,neg
the sea was very dirty due to rainy stormy weather stray dogs running at the beach and overall  very sad to see so much rubbish,neg
cleanliness of the private plunge pool food was overpriced,neg
the internet service very slow,neg
the place where i stay no leg to go up so if you travel with handicap or people who are using wellchair very difficult to go up,neg
be careful of being over charged for everything,neg
slight smell in areas but to be expected with old buildings and area,neg
don’t really have,neg
there could have been access to some staff at night,neg
the bed and the amount of money that is charged for everything including water,neg
the renovation going on right next to our room it felt a bit overpriced in that sense when we were considering staying longer they wanted to charge us more then before instead of going down in price because of the renovation,neg
we had no hot water on our first night from pm due to internal works on their water system and we weren’t informed when we checked in we found out by a note that was left on our bed no staff had told us of this which was disappointing the water was supposed to be back on from pm the cold water worked after this time however still after pm we had no hot water and the cold water from the sink was spitting out a yellow colour we were changed to a different room that night after complaining to the converge they did however give us two free cocktail voucher also disappointed breakfast was not served until after am which isn’t ideal if you have an early morning flight and have paid for the buffets breakfast  we asked for a coffee around am and was told staff wouldn’t make one until after am we expected more from a  star resort,neg
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better,neg
really bad location,neg
you can hear the airplane passing by in the morning and the noise from the guy next door request for enjoining rooms  one of the jets of the jacuzzi tub fell off but was not fixed by the next day  the water pressure of the shower was really weak so we had to take longer to clean ourselves,neg
rooms bit dated towels need all changed past sell by date by a number of years,neg
just a heads up that the resort sits on a hill and some parts are a steep walk especially tough in humid weather fortunately they have golf carts to transport you and your luggage,neg
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights,neg
the bandage resort and sea was starting to show its age accommodation is getting ready for a return and modernisation probably a more family orientated resort,neg
the sea is too shallow so was not possible to swim but the pool is very good,neg
we didn like that the toilets in the room are just separated with a curtain from the balcony no door or wall only curtain,neg
if you want a lot of liveliness you will be able to find it within  minutes drive,neg
we were given a villa that was noisy had no internet and was filled with mosquitoes,neg
this is a resort in the hills there not much to seed within walking distance the hotel provided a scuttle bus to their sister hotel in the busy beach free of charge also the plugs were just a bit far from the bedside,neg
the hotel backs onto a nightclub that plays loud music until am,neg
absolutely nothing at all to dislike,neg
no hot water in my bungalow which i knew before i arrived,neg
mosquitoes please take care of it they were a big pain outside or inside the room staff behavior could have been more inviting than present and lastly the cocktail were devoid of alcohol all the drinks were a complete cheat,neg
there was no in room safe although safety deposit boxes were available at the reception which you had to buy a lock for  in assuming they have learnt from mistakes with the room safes,neg
i liked everything about this propertythe only slight negative is that the beach does have lots of shellspebbles and old coral if you wade bit deeper so you will need water shoes i want fussed about this though kiss will have fun though with the variety of beautiful shells,neg
a shame breakfast was not included the shower in the bathroom could have been stronger,neg
more equipment in the grm would be good also the beach out the front is somewhat rocky so not first choice for a swimming beach but picturesque nonetheless,neg
rubbish on the beach,neg
the biggest downside of oh same is the transport taxidrivers tuktuk drivers and anyone else exploit tourist by charging a fortune for transportation it was as ridiculous as for every km travelled the cost would go up by  bath not even their version of user was very costeffective tourist have no choice but to fork out their money as walking on the roads in oh same is hazardous and the chances of being in an accident are high  so dont,neg
this resort is situated on a hill so be sure to tell your driver that he needs to take you to the top of the hill otherwise they will leave you at the bottom and trust me when i say its not a hill you want to climb especially after a day out,neg
coming home,neg
the hotel is linked to the stadium where the boxing takes place every other day so a bit noisy on some days till midnight,neg
bad internet no english to channels except can breakfast every day the same swimming pool to small good location in lamp and on the beach friendly people,neg
excursions proposed by the hotel were a little on the expensive side would recommend organizing directly with the service provides,neg
bathroom need some work no hot water one toilet had no toilet seat toilet paper dispense in the worst position possible that was really the only let down,neg
was mislead about family room near pool had to pay to upgrade up a very very steep hill food was very poor sister hotel food was outstanding,neg
the wife at the pool is a little weak could be improved works fine anywhere else,neg
coffee at breakfast is not the best and you get charged if you want to upgrade to an express or a late,neg
the room door and windows not close so well so you can hear noise from outside but this problem its not a big problem for me my big problem is if someone sit and smoke in front of the room the smoke smell come through the hole between door and windows so it smell  bad like they smoke inside your room,neg
shower need attention the temperature in different rooms kept varying,neg
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it,neg
some pool chair cushions are quite worn for a  star hotel wooden dealing is starting to look feathered and could use a coat of varnish,neg
when we checked in only  girl on the desk and it took us about  minutes to check in,neg
very close to the port so maybe the sea not very clean,neg
not pleasant to walk around,neg
for the less able bodied the amount of stairs to get to some of the rooms may be an issue,neg
the hotel needs refurbishment breakfast choice is quite limited took the mind that massage with my husband and completely regretted it requested the massage to be in the comfort of our room but they didn’t allow this other hotels in the area provided this service the massage room was smell and the masseuses was talking to each other most of the time no peace whatsoever our room wasn’t exactly clean there were dirtstain marks all over the bathroom glass door major turn off all in all bad value for money i’ve stayed at apasari hotel are tar and apple a day previously nearby hotels which are way better and cheaper too,neg
no mosquito nets in the room,neg
the bed was quite hard i didn find it very comfortable to sleep on,neg
pay extra for getting cappucino coffee at breakfast,neg
hotel is very popular for wedding on the beach and guests are asked not to use the beach when there is a wedding  which i found unreasonable could do with a small selection of water sports facilities like snorkelling equipment maybe some paddle boards some games in the lounge area like cards dominions scramble etcetera would be good,neg
not clean,neg
songthaews in lamp beach scar people but it has nothing to do with the hotel,neg
breakfast has less choice and its the same everyday,neg
it needs refurbishmentlong overduelots of the hotel is tired and jadedtvs are from the s and have  working  channelsthe bathroom is somewhat unmanageable as a wet room the shower is simply the noble above beside the toilet and the whirlpool bath want worth the risk it looked it may have carried the plague every shower therefore rendered the entire floor wash all the way up to the washbasin and mirrorthe loungers on the beach are frankly requiring to be burned as firewoodthe double bed waswere two singles pushed together,neg
the tap in the bathroom was broken and it leaned water on the floor but they repaired it immediately,neg
needed some maintenance in the rooms starting to look a little tired couldn get  keys for the room,neg
it raised quite badly whilst we were there and the villa leaned water in so badly that we had to mop up the water as it was heading towards our belongings and the bed there was also water leaking through the ceiling as the roof times had blown off we called the hotel reception two times to be told they would send someone down to us but no one came they were only gathered about what colour towels we were using to mop up the water my partner had to go to reception in the end and get someone down they weren’t that gathered about what had happened and explained we should have put the blind down that was outside on the balcony unfortunately this was never explained to us when we arrived plus if we had been out for the day we wouldn’t have put the blind down expecting it it rain the manager basically made out like it was our fault not what you expect when you pay over £ pounds per night i would have expected some sort of good will gesture but we got nothing,neg
the rooms are very small  m but the quality is very good great shower beds and breakfast is very nice  we had connecting doors between the rooms with our kiss,neg
the wife in my room was a little predictable but the connection was fine in the lobbyrestaurantreception,neg
staff were pleasant and friendly but completely unresponsiveforgetful with any requests  for example we needed toilet paper called the front desk  hours later still no toilet paper,neg
when we moved on to our next destination we left something behind at kirikayan  it took many phone calls to establish that they had the items even though we were not asking them to send them to us  we just needed a yes or no but this was extremely difficult to get,neg
the pool is lovely and peaceful with a jungle backdrop  peaceful until they inexplicable start playing dance music which varies from relatively mellow to completely irritating  completely destroys the absence and is loud enough that you can hear it on all the balconies overlooking the pool,neg
breakfast is great but main menu could be better beef with my carry was too chew i understand we are on a tropical island,neg
breakfast was very average,neg
be cautious real rooms in this boutique hotel do not match the photo on the bookingcom for example we booked superior villa bungalow suite  there are two large bright rooms with panorama windows to the sea at the photo but the hotel has only one such room in the remaining nine bungalows rooms are small dark with only one window to the pool most likely you will get such room like we got,neg
there were other minor faults eg never changed the linen during  nights but they have no value compared to the awful photo cheating,neg
rooms were very old sheet were torn driver from airport had issues,neg
there were a lot of families and kiss around when we went we are in our early twenties so at times it felt a little much however this is not the fault of the hotel by anymeans it’s perfect for families maybe not so much for those of the younger generation,neg
staff never smiled rooms appalling dirty and no privacy,neg
no personal suffer,neg
if you dont know how to ride motobike location can be a little problem for center it coast bath for one way hotel has  scuttle for day one for lamp beach and one for chewing it wasn’t enough and they offers just one way,neg
the air con in the room down stair was not excellent we were room  perfect room otherwise,neg
get a   story room as air conditioning on ground floors takes in musty smells,neg
only fault would be that a massive centipede was found in our bathroom during our stay stuffed helped immediately but this was our only unpleasant experience,neg
breakfast in the resort is not the best i would exclude this from future booking and go elsewhere for breakfast,neg
there is a very very busy road just behind the resort,neg
the only draw back was the fact that there was a large number of step up to the room however there are bulges to drive you to your room if required,neg
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further,neg
a little expensive for the evening meal but quality of food was good,neg
bit of a drag into the town but we wanted to just chill so it was fine for us,neg
the shower and air con want bill but it worked we hoped,neg
there were ants and a wizard in the room the wife was not consistent in the room the phone number on the bookingcom webster was different from the phone number listed on goose and when i remained the property for the hotel confirmation and airport transportation i did not receive a response,neg
the penza could be better and the pool in the villa could be more cleaner,neg
foreign staff want as friendly as that staff not very accommodation,neg
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in,neg
if you are near the road end of the property the traffic noise can be a little intrusion,neg
нестабильно работал вай фай of отключали ближайшую точку доступа of включали,neg
the hotel had an idyllic setting on the beach with a good infinity pool the italian livid restaurant was on the waters edge and excellent food happy hour was from   pm handy outside but outside hotel very disappointing,neg
nothing i can think of i just wish id taken more photo to show you how awesome the passage was,neg
odor di uffa in reception,neg
equipment in the grm was dated,neg
cleanliness of the room could be improved,neg
i didn like our room it was a bit dusty and dark,neg
but i believe that other rooms which has a sea view are better,neg
beds are a bit uncomfortable,neg
shampoo shower get,neg
not accessible to strolled they have many stairs for each direction you go it is hard to move with a strolled also no pool for kidsshower is very strange it has  door sharing with the toilet and it is glass so everyone  can take a peak main pool bar is expensive,neg
nothing i can think of i just wish id taken more photo to show you how awesome the passage was,neg
big rooms friendly staff,neg
no hot water in the shower which was very disappointing as we paid extra for a room with a whirlpoolwifi was not working properly staff was not very friendlythe fitness center really shouldn’t be counted as one tiny room with only  treadmill and  cross machine working no place to perform exercises bites do not work weights are falling apartthe room was pretty dirty i really felt like grafting a broom and clean the room was also very darkpretty far from the center need to take a bus or a taxi every time you want to eat or book a tour,neg
beach not good for swimming,neg
three things could have been improved the air condition was just a bit loud the water pressure in the bathtubs was way too low despite the fact that the sink and shower had a fine water flow i prefer softer pillows on the bed,neg
that we had to leave,neg
you owe me  neuro please return it immediately on my bank accountthank you,neg
too basic for my liking wood trotting in huts making floors uneven and overhead canopy on porch patch the wooden windows are blackened with the decay it was very quiet but can imagine when busy full of young travellers it would be a friendly community feel,neg
the internet did not work,neg
was about a ten minute walk away from the main strip,neg
this isn really the hotels fault but the clientele was a little trash somehow it attracted lots of chalky peopleovercrowded pool areaoverpriced taxes everywhere on the island,neg
the resort is in a jungle style location therefore there are a lot of mosquitoes and it is not good that the windows in the rooms are not closing perfectly,neg
my room far from the beach,neg
only one socket in bungalow its uncomfortable especially when you travel not alone,neg
the staff on receptionrestaurant hardly speaks english and its a shame they dont understand simple questions like can you give me a weapon please or may i choose among bungalows or mine is the only one,neg
the air in the garden sometimes stink beverage,neg
the mattress on a bed was of spring that caused pain in back,neg
the mattress were not comftroble the bath without window a smell of mold in sleep soothe breakfast was poor and the amount was insufficient for all the guests,neg
attentiveness of the staffpool m cm deepfood breakfast,neg
although we took the pool access villa we could not use the pool as   the maintenance crew pumped fresh cold water in it we stayed  days   and the water was still cold they have only  restaurant with extreme high prices compared with all other  places we have eaten seventy fahrenheit in lamp wiki beach in lips not and other the cocktail at the beach bar were full of ice not alcohol and at a steep price around  dollars each insufficient sunbeam on the beach although hotel was small not a resort as they present himself nobody spoke good english or english at all the breakfast one of the worst breakfast i have ever seen every same thing each morning  follette some bacon rice beans cooked vegetables sausages alternating potatoes or spagetti cantalope  pineapple something like swiss cheeks only single dairy some yougurt some sweets is not possible to have this at a  star hotel with an island filled with fresh exotic fruit you have nothing at breakfasting big issue was that in the third day the follette stand was left unattended and the follette soul had flies in it i told the waiter to take that and throw it away he took it to the kitchenand brought a new soul of follette to be prepared yeah right the next day same problems with the fliesimagine that they have actual coronet trees and coconuts dropping to the ground outside and no coronet fruit at breakfast the hotel taxi is more expensive than regular taxi the free hotel scuttle only goes to one area chewing at   and  pm this limits you are    minutes away of everything take into serious consideration the fact that there is nothing around the hotel for at least  minutes by car fisherman village chewing or lamp nation which is near  minutes by car is not a tourist place,neg
nothing not to dislike,neg
artificial smell of the room,neg
cheap perfume,neg
the ac is rather loud for sleep time even when its power is turned to minimum,neg
we stayed there on two separate occasions the second time was for just a single night in order to catch an early flight the maintenance for that room was not great small stuff which adds up,neg
wife connection was very bad the smell from the water in the shower was disgusting but got better after a while hot meals on the breakfast buffets was not actually hot,neg
a bit more secluded than i would have liked but nonetheless a lovely resort,neg
they do not provide beach towels,neg
the resort is not very that  the design is very contemporary which was lovely but perhaps may not be to some’s taste on the beach the ocean stays shallow for a long time and also has some rocks so it is better for bathing than swimming also it is not super close to bars and restaurant taxes on same are expensive but the hotel restaurant is great anyway for those staying a long time transport could become a large cost,neg
the room had  fan but was really hot during the day and night the rooms also smelled of damp and really in need of a make over wife only available downstairs and want great signal,neg
wife could have been better small but very nice and cool pool,neg
it is a  min walk from town but there are bushes and the owners gave us lifts,neg
sadly the electricity generations are very noisy during the day its not the property fault but its unfortunate location is very quiet and a bit empty in this season but good for those couples who just want to lay at the pool less suited for solo travellers,neg
the reception and restaurant staff were almost completely opposite,neg
restaurant staff would stand there and stare at you while you topped up your plates during breakfast or while you were eating it,neg
ask them for a towel while your in the pool and your told to get it from your room,neg
drunk strand,neg
location slight walk into town but worth it for the place you get construction going on down by the pool at the moment but no big deal,neg
strange that the included breakfast menu had champagne on it but it was never available  my room had tree branches overflowing onto the balcony and when the wind blew there was an almighty scraping sound of the branches onto the woodwork fortunately it want windy at night or sleep would have been impossible  i remember the wife as being rather weak but i experienced that elsewhere in same,neg
there was bags ants and wall wizards,neg
every thing,neg
the location is far from town center,neg
beach is away from the hotel and require a walking distance of  to  mind,neg
surrounding areas  no restaurant or any nearby convenient shops,neg
scuttle bus from airport to hotel or viceversa is charitable at a very high rate,neg
i honestly can say i didn like anything,neg
everything is expensive including transportation,neg
no free scuttle service to airport or main shopping walls,neg
food quality was mid range and the beach is only average in beauty to be honest the alliance is a bit boring and very quite so it is good for those who look for total relax without being disturbed not for having fun airport picked is not free and a bit expensive there were going works to renew the resort when we got there,neg
because we forgot the credit card we booked and paid with back in april there was an issue at check in they refused the original card and charged us on one of the cards we had with us so we lost out on the exchange rate and bank charges,neg
got a manure that was not great staff’s level of english was pretty poor and made it difficult to get help on some things but they were extremely polite,neg
slightly noisy at night even in the building rooms,neg
oh same governing body has not improved or corrected senate issues they reportedly have raw waste that run directly into our already stressed ocean do not recommend the island as a tourist destination until this issue is rectified,neg
a lot of mosquitoes,neg
i did not like having to pass next door suite every time we went to our room small problem but i felt we were invading their space,neg
most everything,neg
bad smell from the shower water,neg
the property was little away from the main market,neg
it was a rainy weather most of the days,neg
the bed want comfortable the smell in the bathroom the rooms appear a bit old and require renovation,neg
plunge pool didn work breakfast poor lacking variety  looking and structural work being done all around so no privacy even in or own pool,neg
dirty towels and dirty sheets stains in it all other very good,neg
food breakfast was cold at times variety was lacking,neg
the pillows were terribly uncomfortable and hard there were tiny ants all over the room especially in the bathroom there was no iron available to use,neg
the reception on check in had an pleasant attitude,neg
the hotel was opened in  and so the wear and tear is visible  walls might be a little dirty tiny cracks and scratches in the furniture etc this is to be expected after operating for  years but perhaps they could ‘refresh’ the rooms a little it really isn’t bad the,neg
the whole property was very untidy  rubbish in the gardens dead plants random pillows dirty swept balcony,neg
the smell of the bathroom was bad they were trying to cover it with air freshened,neg
it is little difficult to find taxi beside the road not always they are going the way you anna go almost all the famous reaches and sights are a bit far from this place that the only thing we dint like about this place,neg
the breakfast was awful cold fried eggs cold baconnot very clean we paid over £ per night to stay hear and it was very  disappointing,neg
hard bed and weak shower,neg
we did not appreciate the location of the hotel that much which is not the fault of the hotel it is literally  min walk from the beach but chosen beach is not the best beach on the island there are also couple of bars and restaurant around the hotel but this is rather quiet environment which we really did not like was extremely bad wife we were travelling through thailand so can say that the connection can be very good but definitely not in this hotel very disappointing breakfast choice was a bit poor as well could do better with more choice of fresh fruitsvegetables,neg
breakfast was not great no buffets not much variety would have liked some that option,neg
nothing  maybe another curtain in the massage room since people can and unfortunately do stand there and look would be a little more relaxing with that extra bit of privacy but the message was fantastic,neg
non availability of the type of room i  had booked,neg
unfortunately the hotel is not on the beach,neg
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up,neg
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost,neg
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food,neg
rooms were a little noisy and music was played until late which could be a problem for families with small children,neg
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising,neg
the kiss swimming pool is very nice but dangerous for little kiss,neg
the hotel restaurant is expensive considering the other ones located next to it and serving same amazing that food,neg
unfortunately there was some problems with the resort the room was dirty sheets and shower the private pool we got was also dirty there is no mosquito nets yet the doors have openings on them that let bags in at night my body had tons of bites every morning our air conditioned broke down and someone came to fix it but it still was hot in the room this resort has the worst internet in the rooms i have a job that i always need to check email at least once a day even on vacation the internet was better on the beach than the room there was a lot of problems and i felt bad for calling down to get things fixed a staff came to fix the internet but it never worked in the room the staff are wonderful but next time i will stay somewhere better i thought for the price of this resort it would be better,neg
room was small,neg
shower very bad hardly any water came put of the tap,neg
breakfast more asia foods and cook bacon fresh,neg
beachfront hotel was closed for renovation however chi beach club next to it was very good,neg
there was no cleanliness during breakfast i saw flies on the food,neg
room was so small no facilities,neg
no cleaning up room service,neg
it was all good,neg
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states “airport scuttle” which is not free description states “canning” but that is not offered at the hotel,neg
doesn have a  star hotel feel breakfast limited more of a boutique hotel bit overpriced rooms,neg
everything was great except for the noise from the cars at night as our room was right in front of the main road,neg
the hotel needs more mind car because  you have to wait  to  minutes before moving,neg
the extra charge for the breakfast in the room it should be free because its far and you have to wait for the car,neg
no hot water at early morning,neg
beach  dirty rubbish strewn not far from port busy road outside the resort much traffic noise,neg
a bit far out of town not really in walking distance in the heat,neg
we paid for breakfast but at the hotel we were told that no breakfast will be served due to closing of the restaurantwifi connection was coexisting didn work anywhere on the hotel areaalso some major construction work was going on  peters from the room luckily we didn sleep long 😀,neg
the room service was little expensive,neg
when we arrived we were very disappointed at the state of the room it was very old and bathroom were gross beds were so hard and the place just looked run down we couldn’t stay there so we booked another hotel down the road,neg
attitude of some employees,neg
it is a pity that the staff was not very welcoming and social the pool was not so clean maybe due to songkran festivities,neg
food viaritythe place is full of mosquitospool full of insects because of the garden,neg
nothing to do with the hotel but bout beach water is not great quality water is very cloudy,neg
too many mosquitoes,neg
not a negative but the bathroom could use some renovation in time the toilet was really low not the most comfortable,neg
the iron leaned and the wife didn work but who cares we weren there to use social media so didn bother us,neg
insects in the villa walk under the doors in to millpool is old and all the furniture is on it last legs breakfast very limited,neg
very bad location no delivered we tried at,neg
beds where hard and not clot of storage for clothes,neg
very much secluded you are pretty much forced to use their restaurant etc unless you hire a carmotor bike,neg
the wife was a joke not to that the password changed every two days,neg
wish the lady cook at the egg station knew how to smile,neg
hire a motorbike to get to chewing beach within  minutes,neg
rooms old and need refurbishment,neg
no safe in the room as indicated in the room descriptionpillows of the bed were too bigsome lights in the room didn work,neg
rooms could use a small table and chairs in them balconies somehow with a bigger ratio out the front on the bottom level,neg
no drinking water next to the pool and the beach you have to order drinks from the bar kiss are spending many hours on the beach and pool and need to drink a lot i think water cooper should be complementary buying mineral water in large bottles which isn’t expensive even can be done only outside of the resort,neg
mosquitoes  especially next to the villa,neg
pool in the vilna clearness,neg
they didn meet us at the airport  as they said they would additional  bart taxi ride,neg
we loved everything,neg
everything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spend,neg
occasional sound disturbance at night from the elephant and ark beach bars,neg
absolutely nothing the hotel was a delight,neg
low water pressure in the shower and toilets  no beach towels,neg
they were building the beach side of the property so there was no direct access to the beach,neg
we were really disappointed with the lack of loungers on the level near the pool this needs to be improved to avoid confrontation,neg
depending on where your room is located you will either have a generous sized ratio area or a smaller one,neg
this is something to consider as if its raining its still hot and its nice to get out of your room,neg
it was a bit grim the cleaner didn’t clean the rooms very well,neg
minor things to improve,neg
the room smelled like cleaner or detergent,neg
the bed was not really comfortable,neg
we had a twin room as we did not see that we had to mark that we want a double room during reservation,neg
the decoration os very old fashioned and there were cockroaches in the room,neg
bathroom had a glass wall so not private,neg
the whole decorations of the hotel the rooms receptions where not too nice i really was expecting a fancier place they put more effort in the party and bars rather than the hotel and rooms,neg
the staff seems to be very tired and stressed they try helping out but once you make a mistake in your order for example or they get confused they blame it on you and talk to you very rude,neg
food is overpriced very noisy with planes flying over so dont stay here if you want to relax,neg
outdoor lights are not enough at all and its scar to move around after sunsethard water supply in the rooms,neg
on a couple of occasions the water cut out  and i would recommend the apartment have brush for sweeping and something to clean with so we can keep tidy,neg
bed sheets could be fresh,neg
nothing it is great,neg
the pool generally beautiful however chemically needs better control very irritating on the eyes,neg
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it’s a great place for children,neg
bathroom not clean hair around the apartment floor had not been swept,neg
not enough beach chairs,neg
very small room and the doors wont lock staff only available until pm,neg
house keeping just pay more attention to the fumigation of the rooms as we experienced on few occasions spiders ants bags even saw a rat but nothing to ruin our trip as it was taken care of i just wish they would make that a priority as cleanliness is extremely important to me,neg
the bathroom they need a serious uplifts,neg
restaurant and bar are good but really overpriced what is annoying  the prices are shown without tax and service so you have to pay  vat plus   service extra and the service is charged even if you take eg one beer from the beach bar yourself happily there is good beach bar close to the beach with very good food and reasonable prices,neg
wife was very bad,neg
was informed that the use of the karay was at a cost  before booking this accommodation we were under the impression that to use the kayaks it was free,neg
its a good  min walk from the centre of lamp the pool and sea are actually in another building on the opposite side of a very busy road although i hey do have a security guard there to help you cross,neg
was slightly noisy due to its location but only a minor issue,neg
the beach is not the best but ok,neg
bungalow was at the back of the resort long and confusing route to and from reception and restaurant,neg
the staff was sometimes not friendly almost rude,neg
the air condition broke and the water start leaking trough the light so we must packed and changed the room in the middle of the night no apology was given from the staff,neg
even i hardly watch to but i think they need to change to new to type,neg
old not a problem,neg
the water temperature for swimming pool to much cold need theater in jan,neg
need more privacy for muslin couples on the sides of the pool,neg
rooms are not like photo shown,neg
not value for money,neg
internet was not good,neg
the private pool is bit smaller not like what it was shown in the picture the loud music from the near local bars at night,neg
iron unit was noisy,neg
the beach was rocky and did not allow for walking along as it didn connect to the rest of the beach as it was blocked by big rocks the food in the restaurant was very average and prices,neg
it could not be better,neg
avoid this property at all costs,neg
it looks nothing like the pictures and water running from the tap is yellow the management specially a guy called fabrizio very patronizing and arrogant person who will laugh at your face when you talk said to me the water was safe to use not to drink,neg
it might have been safe but yellow water is not a great sign,neg
after i complained and we were checking out there were adding or replacing active carbon the their water maybe didn have any in the first place you can see in the pictures,neg
i had more pictures but not on my phone to highlight the lack of maintenance in this place,neg
you can get better hotels for the same money,neg
choose wisely before committing,neg
minor maintenance painting required looked a little tired,neg
one downside was the beach it was frankly dirty the other was the location  it was not close to anything,neg
the resort looked a little old breakfast was very limited and ordinary,neg
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help the breakfast buffets was white overpriced for what was on offer,neg
miserable staff especially on checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave what kind of rift raft have you had to enforce such policies and especially to a returning customer issues with payment machine not having network clearly shown on screen but told my card is declined very poor customer service from daytime staff who can be seen watching couture or localising on facebook most of the day even whilst customers are sitting around in the lobby area they’re all smiles until you ask them to take the key for your room you didn’t have a gigantic plastic rod stuck to the key we could maybe consider taking it with us and in turn wouldn’t need to disrupt you from your amusing video on couture little to no staff by the pool good luck to anyone who drowns pool is grim so i doubt drowning is an issue as you wouldn’t go in in the first placemosquitoes in the room had to request multiple times to get it sorted they come with practically empty can of spray and say that’s all electricity in the room kept turning off we were told someone would come to check it out however no one did turn up prices have gone up and service has gone downthis hotel seems to have changed hands since my last few visits and not for the better other than its location i can no longer recommend it,neg
breakfast option were rather limited but there are many local restaurant nearby,neg
what food we tried in our short stay was great i would like to see more that food on menu at least a daily chess special,neg
was surprised that there were so many families with children when we were there  years ago it was not so the beach beds were in poor condition and too few,neg
far from town quite dark at the mirror,neg
the staff were very helpful and unaware of their facilities offers we knew more than they did from reading the book in the room daytime we asked for anything that was mentioned in the book they were unaware of it eg happy hour we felt uncomfortable asking them for anything even ordering food  drinks was a very big effort we would only ask for something if we really needed it,neg
bedroom  bathroom was not very clean and dated   bedding was very dated  definitely needs an upgrade hotel has  upper floors with no lift  only stairs quite a mission to drag up a heavy suitcase  although the belly brought up our cases  it was a mission going down on check out,neg
the facilities need some improvement the main pool was missing most of its times and to have some privacy inside the villa you need to close the blackouts even during the day the food is not that great the such was very disappointing felt foggy and not fresh at all and the breakfast option were very limited as well as a wiki beach brand was expecting better,neg
wife never worked during our three night stay the villa we booked was actually one half of a villa with no noise drooping we could literally hear the conversations in the next room cleanliness was a miss the villa or the room actually didn appear very clean breakfast had very little option and most of the times were not filled when anything finished in the buffets,neg
we loved everything,neg
prices in restaurant shakes etc are very expensive,neg
a small shop would have been nice to buy some snacks or drinks the first shop is a  minutes walk,neg
bathroom and fitting not to the standard,neg
a hotel scuttle to the nearby may am beach would be desirable there is only a scuttle to the chewing beach sister resort,neg
in not sure whether this is normal in same or not but the pipe water in jacuzzi was not that clear color was a bit yellow,neg
variation of breakfast look the same everyday not what we expected for the price we paid,neg
facilities are a bit old and the whole building looks like it needs a little bit of touch up renovation swimming pool is extremely small and is literally in the middle of the restaurant not comfortable,neg
the surrounding  is not enough developed and make this part of same quite sad for low season,neg
to reach the restaurant and than to come back you have to climb so many steps to go to the room or the reception,neg
rooms not amazing quality but nice enough pool lounge area quite small,neg
can’t walk anywhere from the hotel,neg
nothing 😄,neg
smell and unclean running water,neg
pool closes pm and is missing times room smelled of like urine air conditioned smelled too and if you use it while on balcony the box will blow hot air on you lots of white man staying here with local that woman and chat on a balcony all night,neg
the resort has grown some of the bungalows are a little tired,neg
breakfast can be improved a bit,neg
bed was very uncomfortable,neg
the toilet door would not close,neg
bathroom full of flies even when bought fly spray to kill them full again the next day not sound roofed rooms got a free upgrade to a pool room but women up by kiss at the pool early am all rooms cramped in close together,neg
staff helpful,neg
chairs on the cottage veranda were very uncomfortable,neg
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date,neg
honestly everything was great,neg
very hard bed,neg
had to ask for tea bags milk and sugar,neg
it was too far out,neg
beach not up to expectations,neg
no beach towel provided,neg
it was noisy at night,neg
the reception area is a bid odd also its rather gloomy which somewhat defeated my good mood on arrival the basic colour of the resort  is dark brown  which gives the place a very heavy feel,neg
everything else,neg
pressure of shower was very bad it was challenging to wash long hair hotel staff seemed to be tired and bored almost no smiles seemed they didn want to do their job night shift didn speak english no option even get morning coffee before am even if  breakfast was paid we went to boattrip at  and they only said that well have breakfast included there slice of cook banana and coffee is not breakfast disappointing  we had paid for breakfast no refund,neg
the smaller beds of the kiss could be softer,neg
rooms were very cold could not work out air con but was not a big issue,neg
to far from everywhere and you had to be a mountain goat if you walked,neg
noise from the street vehicles no real nature in the proximity the beach also very busy,neg
the pool was in a bad state not maintained and they promised airport scuttle and later refused,neg
the rooms need an upgrade bathroom is tired wife could be better but who spends their time at the internet that much anyway on holiday,neg
breakfast is great but main menu could be better beef with my carry was too chew i understand we are on a tropical island,neg
fantastic place so quiet and pictures,neg
still a little hot in the room even through i had a bed that was closer to the ac this time then before,neg
absolutely nothing,neg
it was so noisy all night people coming and going i was awakened every hour this really let the experience down,neg
the room was so small i could hardly fit my luggage,neg
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible the furniture was ruined old and in some spots you can find mold the bathroom were a joke the shower area was topped by a plastic waved roof with no induration and holes therefore any type of insects or small animals can have an easy entrance inside the rooms we have found several slums cockroaches and nails in our bathroom after we checked in and entered into the bedrooms oh man it smelled of mold and milder our bedsheets smelled of mold as well after we slept through the first night we could not wait to have at least a wonderful  star luxury breakfast in the morning well we were shocked when we saw the following foggy bread and other pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund for the time period remaining from our planned stay but the management denied our request instead they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine unfortunately we did not get much help from bookingcom either this was more of a clamping experience with a much higher price tag just for the record we had to stay in this facility for  days and paid a lot of money for the above the staff tried to help and compensate but we remained very disappointed  we did not get what we paid for in the end,neg
food is not so that construction noise above woke us up as early as am,neg
dont trust the online maps telling you there is a store or an at nearby the only way to find those without walking for half a day is to rent a motorbike or pay for the taxi the taxi as always on the islands is very expensive the minimum fare is  bath for a one way trip to lips not pier be advised though that this hotel is not on the main route for hotel transfers despite being very close to the pier the van waiting may ask you more than  bath so its not a bad idea to call the hotel to plan your transfer from the pier,neg
lack of service in the restaurant—the staff stayed in a corner to themselves chatting and ignored the customers,neg
next time we would not get the dulled as walking up and down the stairs to the bathroom was a little inconvenient,neg
things you will hatemosquitoes are everywhere you will start to stay at room to escape from crazy mosquitoes or you will scratch yourself by bleeding if you are brave enough to stay outsidehumidity level is crazy you will see  at nights and will sweat as hellsea temperature is higher than weather so taking shower is fresh way than swimmingany price you will see is not vat included they do not add in total taxes to price lists on venus or their offer,neg
ac too loud,neg
air con and fridge not working properly small blood stains on bed sheets,neg
basis of hotel are right just needs a bit of maintenance can see that not much work gets done dealing around pool some boards are loose and screws sticking up wife is patch and on nd floor almost unable had to go to lobby,neg
not hotels fault but the beach is not good for babies as it is not shallow and the sea was pretty wavy also even tough wife reception was good the connection is very slow,neg
great hotel for  stars categorymaybe some beddingsrestaurant  napkins and towels could be renewed or refreshed and housekeeping management can pay a bit of attention to quality,neg
pas de wife,neg
every thing was good didn have any complaints will book here again next time in in same,neg
actually anything,neg
this was marked as a water park but it had closed and our  year old daughter was very upset the maid was very rude and told us our feet sunk i would like my money back,neg
the whole villa smelt extremely dusty upon arrival and although it looked completely clean it smelt unclean it was also extremely dated and is desperate for a return wouldn’t personally stay here again but was okay for what we needed it for,neg
frequency of scuttle bus is not enough in peak season and time should be adjusted according to the request of guests swimming pool is too salt for swim,neg
we stayed in  rooms   and   in rooms  and  there was a distinct drainage smell  which was very unpleasant for our entire stay  we also had numerous mosquitoes in our room  other than that it was a beautiful place and we enjoyed our stay,neg
location is a bit isolated but it was very relaxed and had a good vice if someone is looking to stay out of main crowded areas its perfect,neg
struggled with english with some members of staff but when more client people was around had no issues,neg
the staff is sometimes not very responsive to phone calls from the room or they may forget to do something such as bringing additional bottles of water,neg
our air conditioned  thermostat seemed to have broke in the middle of the first night resulting it to constantly turn on and off which disrupted our sleep the bathroom was not completely cleaned when we checked in we found a child toy in the shower,neg
the hotel was not very responsive to email but rather more responsive via bookingcom,neg
really bad maintained resort location pool very bad rooms out dated i would not recommend this resort at all,neg
the hotel itself was dated and in need of refurbishments the water pressure in the shower was inconsistent it often cut out and the temperature was on the cooper side whilst they tried their best it was difficult at times to communicate with staff,neg
there ware a lot of problem with the room  toilet the window air condition the hotel is not on the main road so the only ay to get a taxi is to order from the hotel and it is always big cars and expensive,neg
the sound of the jacuzzi kept me up all night it was deafening i recorded it to show to the manager but she didn seem gathered for   accommodation i would have expected a little more,neg
the room didn have a bath tub,neg
needs to provide a scuttle service to lamp bathroom need a reap and a proper clean was given different price quotes for the same thing by different staff members which makes one suspicious,neg
the sea and beach close to the hotel were not the best of the island,neg
the beach area is beautiful but is spoiled by plastic bags and rubbish in the water there is an area right next to the bring which is just covered in bags and rubbish in our times of clearing and cleaning up the ocean no one seems to care there there are also no bind at all anywhere either the complex or on the beach,neg
the beach bar area could be made to look so much better it was empty most nights  because the singers are so off key they put people off from eating there the singing was terrible   if you look around everyone else changes their look of their restaurant at night to make them prettier the hotel needs to put an effort in making the beach area more luxurious nice table cloths hanging lanterns lights on the wall to show people you are there pretty sheets to make areas more cosy the food at the restaurant is excellent you just need to utilise the space,neg
the beach bar could do so much better the cocktail took forever to be made prices of drinks there were so much more than the local nearby restaurant,neg
you could have theme parties not just at night but during the day too there just was no entertainment at all it would have been lovely to see some that dancers or traditional entertainment as well as just listening to modern music,neg
breakfast was ok but was exactly the same thing each day,neg
there are areas within the complex which need renovation balconies were very worn some rotten which is worrying especially if you have children the plunge pools should be on times instead of having to call reception to turn them on and off each day the pools need cleaning our pool had a black sum around the water line gutters need emptying when it rains water falls everywhere except where its meant to go,neg
the beds were rock hard i felt like i had slept on the floor each night they looked luxurious until you laid on it,neg
the location quite remote from everything,neg
lots of little things had to ask for hand towels  days in a row blind and light fitting broken in our room breakfast on one day came with bacon  i’m vegetarian and bacon wasn’t on the  option i ordered they just took it back to kitchen and scraped off bacon i had a fresh one cooked for me in the end lunchtime penza was awful dry biscuit base tactless and served cold evening meal creamy mushroom past do salt as to be almost incredible,neg
pool area needs work doing broken times and uneven dealing make it a bit hazardous some new pool towels wouldn’t go amiss either,neg
altogether a bit disappointing,neg
sometimes wife was a little slow but not an issue,neg
shower was a bit poor and no workers to hold your valuables,neg
its far away from the main street also clot of mosquito,neg
no real separation in the room between the restroom and the main room,neg
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel,neg
the fact there were clot of stray  dogs that looked flea ridden and scared for  this is not a reflection on the hotel but will point out there was a lot of work going on and was really noisy when you sat on balcony and it went on all day so did ruin the quickness of hotel to be honest,neg
the entrance and reception look quite bad the first impression is really important i felt like i’m in a  stars resort until i saw the roomsome new equipment for the grm will be awesome,neg
there were many rocks in the beach just outside the resort making swimming more difficult we upgrade from our original booking the room booked was called superior double with garden view it was very old small and disappointing as not like the photo on bookingcomor taken many years ago unfortunately  some of the staff spoke and understood only a little english making communication more difficult,neg
the main pool is a bit odd no lounge chairs beside pool they up on other level and the swim up bar they have to run away and get the drinks elsewhere,neg
the sand is very grain and the water is unclear with plenty of see weed inside the stairs taking you down to the beach are very slope and dangerous definitely not designed to take down elderly people or such who are unable to move well  the distance from the reception to the rooms is enormous so get ready for long walks as mentioned before look for astride in case you need assistance the customer relations associate mr michael could rather make your stay unpleasant,neg
bit of a drag into the town but we wanted to just chill so it was fine for us,neg
the shower and air con want bill but it worked we hoped,neg
open bathroom which is only acceptable for couple noisy bed when moving and unstable,neg
this could so easily have been a great stay we arrived at  and our room want ready they told us to come back in an hour after a long day of travel that frustration,neg
get to the room the wife doesn work,neg
run the bath and the water is brown honest to god brown unable,neg
accommodation is a bit dated now needs some dating and maintenance iron upstairs  was not working well to no channels general maintenance required especially the shower upstairs,neg
the choice of breakfast was limited especially for my girlfriend who does not like that food the choice was minimal,neg
in our bungalow not too much space to put our clothes one wardrobe with two shelves,neg
property is a bit old and okay in terms of maintenance  food is okay could be better  breakfast spread is just okay,neg
we are double charge and the refund is still on the progress at this moment when i am doing the rating for them,neg
bathroom and shower were tiled in black and needed a good clean room cleaning was a strange arrangement where you left your room key in a basket downstairs which was accessible to all so it didn feel secure,neg
furniture was old and soft furnishing dusty and in need of replacement,neg
surrounded by other properties so access to the street and beach was down an unit dirt track,neg
a lot further from may am pier than we anticipated too far to walk and cost bath to get there by taxi,neg
reception staff could get hospitality standards a bit more up to date,neg
breakfast,neg
a lot of construction bad beach dirty spot for the sea,neg
restaurant are a bit limited there are  but only  are on work if you want to stay in the resort lunch option is only  in breakfast menu are limited i stayed with my little kid most of food are western type i think they need to add more asia option,neg
the price in the restaurant was extremely higher than other hotels restaurant in chewing beach,neg
minutes walk to the fishermen’s village which isn’t really a bad thing actually wonderful place,neg
beds and pillows are very stiff did arrange to swap pillow for a softer one and got used to the mattresshaving booked and paid for  rooms for  nights each i thought we deserved a modest free upgrade from standard room to standard triple so we could be downstairs alongside the rest of our family in the  triple rooms after the first  nights the resort was only half full but we had to pay the difference,neg
ac not supper effective and loud in room  but fan available,neg
there is  no smoking  room,neg
prices bar and restaurant the menu prices do not include  service and  vat,neg
sofa in our villa want too comfortable,neg
toilet seat was too high,neg
lack of atmosphere not a suitable swimming beach many stairs to climb around,neg
it took much effort to shift the umbrella for some shadow the pool staff did not help at all to shift the sun loungers or heavy umbrella the pool staff had difficulties understanding english,neg
the only thing i really didn like was the pillows they were terrible if i go back which i might in not bidding when i say i might bring my own pillows,neg
the beds are also quite firm but still pretty come,neg
other than that perfect hotel,neg
too many people with babies and kiss the weird thing was that they take those kiss even to sunday branch events where they swim in the pool next to sex dancers and also almost jumping on your head while you are in the pool drinking contains and enjoying sunday branch with do could be more option lumen free food at breakfast,neg
not enough space to put toiletries but used what space we had needed to be pretty active to climb up and down the stairs to the villa  perhaps a good thing to help burn off the weight from eating the delicious that food,neg
they can not manage the hostel bar when you buy your drink cheaper from a market they do not let you drink it in the bar outside they confuse about the checks in the bar once i bought a beer from a market they thought that i took it from the bar and then they issued me a bill for  days this was not kind at all for service,neg
the bed was the forest i have ever sleep on,neg
room smelt a bit mould,neg
everything was wonderful but we had booked it as all inclusive as that is what it said but it was far from all inclusiveyou could only eat certain foods from certain venus and only soft drinks where inclusive so couldn do all we wanted as we didn budget for all we had to spend,neg
claim tomb en paine,neg
we had a small room without windows that was petty claustrophobic,neg
some of the facilities need a little rendering and  beach towel per person per day is a little inconvenient,neg
no place to put your clothes in the room because of the large balcony the room itself was small,neg
limited variety of breakfast menu but mummy still,neg
i didn like that i couldn change me flight tickets to stay more,neg
isolated location where you’re unable to access anything else without a  minute taxi rideconstant background music across hotel that we could even hear in our roomroom was so dark couldn’t see to get ready in the eveningshotel was not busy at all and staff were still slow with taking orders and delivering drinkscocktails contained barely any alcohol and were well above the standard price in other bars on the island menu should be reviewed by someone who speaks client english as some cocktail had offensive names racistyou should be able to get the room service menu in the bar at night it’s crazy to have to go to your room just to get a snack when you want to sit in the bar area water want hot enough to run such a big bathtubs did get it to eventually but took attempts at wasted baths no jacuzzievening entertainment was the same two singers who were not beat enoughlots of the other guests were french and taking part in activities in the evening as part of a holiday group this is not a problem but unfortunately we were the only guests that weren’t a part of the group and as a result it feels uncomfortable to sit in shared areas when activities are being held for everyone else except you even the music played was frenchoverall on the surface it is a good hotel but the longer we stayed the more disappointed we became,neg
air conditioning was medium,neg
the sea view villa does not have a bath tub and bookingcom into on room did not highlight this point for villa guest we would expect a complimentary airport transfer but they charge  bath for  ways transfer later we found out that if we had book directly with hotel the charges will be waived,neg
nothing i didn like,neg
the room was very simple not very clean and very far away from the rest of the hotel we know that the room floor want clean because after a few mind of crawling our baby knees got very dirty,neg
we also requested a room on the first floor because we were traveling with a baby we got a room on the second floor and there were only stairs no elevator which want very accessible with a sleeping baby in a strolled,neg
the pool seemed not clean we didn go in the beach area want nice we went to the beach in a nearby hotel and it was much nicer the hotel is also a little bit far from the shopping areas we needed a taxi to get there,neg
i have stayed at the blue wagon on other occasions and i did not like the fact the water in the shower was not clean it had a slight smell and was a light brown colour which i reported this was the only complaint i can have,neg
the service sunk managers and staff were condescending to us for staying only two nights the bar doesn know how to make a drink and they missed our wake up call its a shame because the place is top notch but has a staff that makes you feel like your being slammed,neg
we as it was our honeymoon holidays have loved everything no weaknesses point,neg
there is nothing which i could complain about,neg
the pillows provide are far too deep sponge like and hard  if you ask though they will provide softer pillows no problem,neg
the service in the restaurant at night can be predictable  they seemed to be rushed off there feet on occasions even though the restaurant was not that busy at all  also food ordered particularly a carry dish was stone cold  even after sending back still want hot,neg
lastly make sure you travel with  any payment card you used for the booking as they need to see it or you will have to make alternative payment and be refused the original payment as happened to me,neg
strange that the included breakfast menu had champagne on it but it was never available  my room had tree branches overflowing onto the balcony and when the wind blew there was an almighty scraping sound of the branches onto the woodwork fortunately it want windy at night or sleep would have been impossible  i remember the wife as being rather weak but i experienced that elsewhere in same,neg
nothing to dislike,neg
some of the bar staff could have been trained better but that was only highlight because of one particular member of staffs efficiency  more selection on the happy hour would have been appreciated,neg
nothing hotel beautiful streets in oh sum  really poor and dirty,neg
maybe the unique shortcomings is the expensive price of the extra comparing with other places out of the resort,neg
breakfast are it’s one big joke ‘ the chef are seating inside and killing time on their phone the food it’s bordering enable ‘ little choice and super small are and funny vice and little space  ‘avoid it if you can cleanliness it’s just ok,neg
the beach on the first day seems a bit dirty and lots of debris of broken glasses porcelain and not pleasant looking the staff claimed its because of the rain and washed from the sea whenever there is heavy rain but on our day  we found the beach looks very clean and nice the kiss have the water activities yet still lots of jelly fish in the water,neg
blatantly money hungry hostess was looking always to charge us as much as possible at every turn  expensive bike hire and most offensively charging us  bath for a  minute taxi ride the taxi driver halted the fee because even he saw how cool the hostess was,neg
the huge bee in our room but it eventually flew away,neg
everything was nice,neg
close to my room was an area which was used as a dump an old broken toilet had been left here you saw this numerous times each day,neg
insects in the room plus staff could not understand english at all the place was also very far from the main  city areas the entire area closed down around pm,neg
see check,neg
bad lightning in the room and there were no elevator,neg
bed was a bit too firm,neg
no safe or fridge in budget room,neg
not enough umbrellaschairs at the beach,neg
the hotel is looking a little tired and a couple of areas and could do with a bit of a make over however this did not retract from our holiday,neg
the general checking and reception staff were underwhelming i got a different answer to the same question depending on who i asked reception operate at  star level whereas the rest of the resort is tapping  star,neg
too many stairs ll,neg
there is still a lot of room for improvement,neg
war allies okay,neg
the bank bed was not stable at all we were afraid it might collapse while climbing up it made noise as you moved the garden view is a view of a construction outside the hotel,neg
too much chlorine in the pool,neg
small room a bit noisy,neg
a bit away from the busy streets attractions however hotel provides a scuttle at no extra cost to the beach and main street,neg
toilet was broken  no hot shower  very small room valuable for what we paid but i expect toilet and hot shower would be fair for money,neg
the  bath for  person to the airport was expensive when we got to the resort for  bath for  people,neg
some staff members at reception not all were quite rude food could be cheaper,neg
the breakfast buffets was left uncovered and many many flies were in all of the food,neg
flushing toilet would be great considering there is water pipe already,neg
the place wasn’t so cleanse entrance door to the room wasn’t so much as a door more like a window that hasn’t closed completely,neg
the wife connection was really bad,neg
the beach is dirty and very small the place is very isolated,neg
slow wife,neg
bed too hard  very hard,neg
although we did mention it and they gave us extra duets to put under the sheet x bit better x,neg
drink bit to expensive in beach bar but happy hour helped,neg
no bind in rooms and bind in shared bathroom needed emptying more often  bed form was smaller then expected,neg
nothing it was perfect,neg
due to us being a young couple we were put in a basic room next to the stairs and under the restaurant therefore it was really noisy at night when trying to get to sleep,neg
though we could not fault the food the service was extremely slow and un organised even found the witness to be quite rude,neg
private pool was really dirty and the bubbles weren’t working,neg
the only thing what i kind dislike was the airconditioning its too cold because it blows very hard towards the bed even on the lowest stand and its very warm to turn it off and use only the fan the hotel could change the system for an air not so powerful,neg
just a shame the part of the hotel on the beach side was undergoing renovation but will look spectacular when finished,neg
staff on reception wasn’t very helpful,neg
bathroom had a glass wall so not private,neg
what became apparent at pm was that we had booked in party central  the local disco boomed and i do mean boomed from pm until am  i was informed by the sleeping night receptions when i woke him at am that this was normal and happens every night,neg
i did not sleep at all that night and by am had booked alternative accommodation  we had repaid for  nights and only stayed one  we tried to nationalism with the manager that they should at least refund us for one night  that was a no go  so that became dead money,neg
nothing i can think of,neg
the buffets restaurant should be more often,neg
not much to complain about really want too happy with paying a  surcharge for paying by credit cardhow else are you supposed to pay,neg
swimming pool would be better with a bigger one and the beach a bit dirty i meant not like a few years ago much cleaner but totally it is a good place to stay i’ll recommend a friends to go there’s,neg
requested air con be looked at seemed to work better but was still a bit noisy,neg
the only issue was the language barrier as front of house staff found it very to understand us and invariably they needed to get another person to handle the request  given the high numbers of english speakers visiting thailand the hotel should be able to converse at a basic level,neg
the rooms we booked x were not up to expectations in a four star resort  our room wasn’t very clean so were upgrade to the sea suite room which are more in the category of  stars anyway our other family members stayed where they were,neg
if according to age  the steps in the room are quite dangerous in the dark as they cannot be seen so very easy to fall down  these rooms need to be upgrade otherwise lower the price of the rooms,neg
after checking we dropped the language in our room and went directly to the pool when we arrived at the pool  construction worker were starring at us since there was a rebuild of the area between restaurant and pool which was very noisy the english knowledge of the staff is that bad that they could not explain us the situation the next day we had breakfast between brick layers one of the construction worker even washed his hands in the pool the staff at the restaurant which is also responsible for the pool is very lazy but playing with their mobile phone all day long so dont worry if you have to prepare the sunbeam and the sunshine on your own  we did it our self and all the other guests too,neg
location was not ideal but it was close enough to what i needed cleanliness could have been a bit better but it was satisfactory,neg
although not hotels fault the van opposite that turned into a noisy outside bar isn pleasant if staying in penthouse  also wouldn recommend studio left room number  as next to staff accommodation and noisy from  am sounded like washing machineand no comfortable balcony seating which was available in all other rooms best accommodation are the ground and st floor rooms overlooking the beach,neg
everything about among is great from the hosts to the rooms to the facilities to the location we loved it,neg
the restaurant was nicely located next to the sea and the view was beautiful unfortunately the staff at the restaurant was not at the same level as at the hotel the service was slow and not very professional,neg
nothing really to note as only stayed for  night,neg
beach is nice and warm water the clarity of the water leaves some to be desired in it’s not a clear water beach but i think those are not very common on same not a lot to see nearby the hotel in close driving distance plus the taxes on same charge more for the same distance than elsewhere in thailand,neg
housekeeping was generally good but could have been more consistent occasionally bath towels were missed or tea bags not supplied or a reduced number of water bottles however these were minor matters so there isn too much to improve,neg
breakfast was only average i expected more variation,neg
the restaurant only offers very few dishes for lunch and dinner plus compared to other restaurant its quite price,neg
no elevator entrance is through a smell foggy looking passage way with dubious people behind alley dont recommend if your a woman it might be scar,neg
couldn sleep do to neighboring using playing all night until  am it was so loud you would think its right next door windows dont insulated very well,neg
wife didn work in my room,neg
bed was wobbly and uncomfortable,neg
windows are really unnecessary as the view is on next door building like m away and trash looking,neg
would not recommend staying here really,neg
i had a birthday and the staff missed flowers from different friends forget to put birthday cards but at the end problem was solved restaurant and pool bar a bit price but you have lots of restaurant in five minutes drive from hotel,neg
the room for cost was ok,neg
die strange links und rights des hotels,neg
door to room was a little fiddle also slight gap in door which let mosquitoes in,neg
the resort facility is not designed for kiss it is recommended for the resort to consider the no kiss below  years old policy,neg
hotel looking tired and cleanliness of corridors was poor with stains on the floor toilet on ground floor had broken lock our bathroom smelled and i discovered a leaking sink with towels in the cupboard underneath to soak up the water this could of been fixed,neg
the western owner of the place was nice and helpful but if he want there the staff couldn speak english almost at all i found really hard to talk to them even about the very basic stuff sundry breakfast etc which i found very annoying and which lead to some small misunderstanding,neg
the only thing we didn’t like about the resort was having to leave we should have stayed longer,neg
the location of the property is not very convenient and we were aware of it but we expected that the hotel could be more active on providing more transportation they already have scuttle bus to the sister hotel in chosen beach but need to book for stand so is not very flexible this honestly is something easy to do and it will make the stay even more comfortable,neg
while it is clear sensimar is working on minimizing its footprints eg straw made from plants a little more could be done eg more began option on menu less single use bathroom products remove elephant breaking from tour option etc,neg
liked it all bit of a walk up the hill but nothing too much as long as you avoid the heat of the middle of the day worth it for the peacefulness,neg
just dont like the pool area  people smoking everywhere and its not that big pool but i had my privat small pool in villa room so i dont care here,neg
the shower is not as we expected,neg
the food was of poor quality and absolutely overpriced the traditional that night buffets  which was very prices  ended up offering basic that food option good for tourist and a very sad that dance show i suggest anyone staying here to go out to lunch and dinner since the restaurant we tried outside the resort were all outstanding,neg
could do with a face lift looks a bit tired and dated,neg
breakfast was average no one told us you could order eggs from the kitchen in fact no one came to us at all the cushions on sun loungers are old and frayed so we just stuck to our little pool which was fine,neg
we were put off using the sea because of the prices but there are a range of places on the reaches that offer various massage,neg
the blanket lookedfelt just like a towel i found it way too cold during the night wish they offered a better towel,neg
the money exchange rate was high,neg
was given a room which connected to another room with just a thin door in between despite complaining had to stay in that room,neg
nothing all was good,neg
very noisy due to may that stadium,neg
no bedside lamp no exhaust in toilet people going up or down the stairs is very loud because of sound echoes,neg
manual toilet  not for me,neg
no complaints we had everything we needed,neg
buffets food is not the best the birds were stepping on tables and cauteries on the buffets table which is not very hygienic,neg
the room was basically directly next to the street and when staying inside it seemed like the cars would drive by my bed i had to sleep early but it was impossible the bathroom in general was not really nice smell and no window for air circulation,neg
many mosquitoes,neg
the free activities could be a little better quality,neg
the sooner rental is almost half price in the shop next door than in the hotel,neg
staff is very perfunctory which may be the culture but a bit of warmth could be nicer,neg
smell and dirty water in shower and sink,neg
the kitchen is okay the food isn amazing nor it is bad breakfast is decent but i recommend eating out most of the time for lunch and dinner as you can find better food for lower prices,neg
the staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refused,neg
not as close to the main part of town as i had thought  had to walkabout min in not lazy  was travelling with older family,neg
cost of sea,neg
the breakfast can be better,neg
the only thing was the hard bed but that the norm in thailand,neg
location was not the best in terms of things to places to eat however it was near the waterfalls and the staff are more than willing to arrange a taxi the hotel also offers a free scuttle beach to the next beach,neg
staff need to be more proficient in english restaurant staff dont understand what you are asking for i used a sundry bag,neg
that was in the room and was charged  the on check out they did not put up a notice in the room that it was charitable this for me was embarrassing bathroom amenities are limited and not sufficient in  one small soap for  persons i had to buy one for myself from the super market its a no smoking room but there was an astray in the balcony there is also a penalty of  the for smoking in the room it is possible they can accuse you of smoking and charge the penalty  also i dont like the idea of paying for the full stay in advance and non refundable too,neg
breakfast was not value for money  we ate out at the market regularly to get more that variety    there was poor quality that dishes and they regularly ran out  egg station was great but we were there for  days so it got a bit boring,neg
i am very disappointed with this hotel the room there were bad smellsthe blankets had a bad smell clothe air conditioning did not work very wealth restaurant the transfer hotel airporthôtel the sea etc had prices much higher than average in samuiin the moment of the check out they charged in my account  bars because they did not find an umbrella that was in the room so we probably left it somewhere in the hotel my opinion it is ridiculous because at the beginning we did not sign an initial inventor of things that were in the roomthis hotel doesn deserve  stars,neg
the pool closes at   a little too early  the bar also closes at   no music and lacked atmosphere,neg
began option on the menu would have loved to eat here,neg
amazing private villa,neg
the furniture and the room little old,neg
breakfast was quite bad not really a copy restaurant no bar at night rooms are outdated,neg
the restaurant,neg
we stayed in one of the standard sea view rooms and a wizard came into our room the first evening we discovered there was a sizeable gap between the sliding doors and the glass exterior  obviously where the wizard had entered this made me a bit uncomfortable so we explained and asked to change to one of the economy inside rooms our request was accepted but with great hostility befitting my fears and making us feel guilty in a very defensive manner as a result we felt very awkward and uncomfortable with that member of staff for the rest of our stay,neg
the bathroom in room  and i am guessing most twin rooms are the same it has a very small slope or step which rides off from the basins area to the bathtubs shouldn’t be there as there could be elderly or drunk person stating could break their ankle and it can easier be done for instance always forget about the little step being there after i washed my hands and coming out of the bathroom,neg
the bed linen did not feel clean also the plates at breakfast seemed ruby and the staff had to be told to clean up food villages on the floor,neg
beds  are very uncomfortable it feels like if you would sleep on the floor,neg
except st floor building is too simplest looks like a hospital but everything is very clean and it is quiet enough to be relaxed一瞬病院と思うくらい白くてびっくりする建物なのですが、とても清潔ですし、問題ありません。of、アメニティは充実していないのでご注意を。toothbrush and paste are not set,neg
room not clean up every day,neg
too many stairs and not much can be done about it as it’s literally carved in a hill,neg
very sterile feel  reminded us of a hospital,neg
none of the machines in the grm worked,neg
the air con was very loud and kept us awake,neg
the door to the balcony did not lock,neg
the staff were not client in english and the rooms are a bit small although not a big issue,neg
the air con in the room down stair was not excellent we were room  perfect room otherwise,neg
a hotel scuttle to the nearby may am beach would be desirable there is only a scuttle to the chewing beach sister resort,neg
the hotelstaff and facilities,neg
restaurant was not open at night,neg
this was our rd stay at grand that house and the service has declined on our first  visits we hired a sooner through the hotel this time they couldn t help us even when they have signs at reception about hire breakfast could be improved clot,neg
the location is a bit far away from the reaches but definitely good if you want to enjoy a quiet vacation,neg
unfortunately the first day check in one small cockroaches was behind the curtain,neg
internet could be better tends to fade in and out,neg
breakfast is average,neg
my friend and i did not get the garden view rooms as we had booked due to over booking,neg
the beachfront staff are a little lazy when it comes to service concerning sunbeam and drinks sometimes they would refuse to help you,neg
once we spoke to the manager len the service improved slightly,neg
i did book  more rooms for  days in january of  only based on the fact that i like the location and price i was also assured by the manager len that the service would be better and i would get the garden courtyard rooms well fingers crossed,neg
but hotel noisy in the morning housekeeping not possible to sleep after  am,neg
the location of the hotel is a little bit far from the main road about  peters of walking on the road with a beverage river under the loathe smell is not so good its not so bad but its an issue,neg
the beach of the hotel itself is not the best beach of lamp going south  peters there are a better reaches,neg
it was all fine,neg
ac broke down and i had to move to a downgraded room they did give a free dinner and free transfer to airport on the last day the water went off twice for hours,neg
desk staff were a but grumpy,neg
shower and toilet in too close proximity,neg
there were mosquitoes in the room should provide mosquito repellent also there were no ceiling fan in the room which meant we had to keep the airconditioning on all the time when indoors and could not enjoy the fresh air bathroom was not thoroughly cleaned mould times around tub,neg
watch out for traffic along the way in dark,neg
i didn receive phone messages sent to reception from the up no phone in the room noisy air conditioning the same music was played every morning at breakfast  very annoying,neg
there is no wife in the room  staff not very much speak english we asked some information about the hours  taxi etc but did not get enough information,neg
wife wasn’t working,neg
internet was a bit hit and miss at times,neg
nothing not to like but the iron might be loud to some sensitive ears,neg
the resort is nice but we founded busy and crowded finished getting very old humidity stains on the walls very old towels literally falling apart awful bed pillows fixed shower head no hand held shower very poor lighting in the bathroom no full size mirror,neg
don’t make guests wait  minutes at checkout so you can check the minimal  it implies you don’t trust them when they say they haven’t used it,neg
next to a night market that plays loud music every night until midnight,neg
first day no electricity caused by outside source but was not refreshing after long journey obviously no generation present if you are not familiar with riding a motorbike then choose a place where you have everything in walking distance otherwise this place is great,neg
the receptions guy was horrible he speak very badly order a cab with him for go back to the airport taxi was very late and i was very worried told me  you can go by yourself,neg
only downside were the hard beds which we had read about not a game changes when all the other facilities tramp this,neg
bed was very uncomfortable and in there is no pipe in the shower,neg
breakfast was not up to the mark,neg
although the room had no ac the fan want bad for the evening and night in september if you plan to hang out in the room during the day though you should get a room with ac,neg
we stayed here over the christmas holidays with our family and friends the hotel did not seem to be ready for the christmas high season when we arrived our suites were not ready in fact they were still penalizing the modeling we had various issues with our room including pest management one of our little kiss stepped on a bee inside our room we heard construction noise throughout our stay the restaurant staff were overlooked and harried though they tried their best  the beachfront is set stop a sand bed with a rock wall and steps down to the beach with very little actual sand even though all the other hotels on this strip of may am beach just have direct access to the wide sandy beach overall we felt there were better resorts at this price point in oh same and we just didn receive the same level of warm hospitality that we have come to expect in thailand,neg
horrible wife,neg
you are committed to hotels scuttle times for going out to the city,neg
last pick up back is early,neg
they need to educate their restaurant staff on hall good and they need to cater properly for hall clients especially when it come the the pressing of food,neg
the croissants and other bread were not crisp,neg
the massage was great,neg
the bar want open on the night we stayed which was unusual considering it was a friday,neg
it isn’t that i don’t like i’d say that the choice in the restaurant’ menu can be more that authentic,neg
not think,neg
everything was great,neg
people with mobility problems should stay on the ground floor rooms since there is no elevator,neg
apart from the beach there agent a whole lot of activities that are really close by but if that doesn bother you then hey go for it we rented a sooner to drive around which was nice,neg
das fruhstuck ist twas einfallslos,neg
not much maybe in the family villa the small room could have been bigger and benefit from the same amenities as the large room,neg
lot of stairs and walking required,neg
nothing loved it all,neg
nothing everything was amazing,neg
same breakfast menu everyday,neg
amazing private villa,neg
the staff were very unfriendly always trying to sell and coffee when not accepted their prices are very inflated and do not reflect the level of service provided by other resorts we stayed at in thailand,neg
in disappointed that i cannot book the same room when i come back in december  it must be quite popular,neg
its an old property and not well maintained at all the doors were falling apart shower leaking sink didn drain fully,neg
our room was never cleaned during our stay,neg
staff should be trained how to do their job,neg
we were very disappointed with this hotel food was less than average we had a very disappointing experience with room service were food turned up unhooked it took a further two hours to get a replacement there were areas around the restaurant that had water around them but they are currently empty consequently this enabled the rats to move in at know time did we see a duty manager or any form of management very dissatisfied,neg
the room is on the beach but right next to a bar  as well as a noisy road so we had noise from both bar music and the road the times in the room were broken the shower has no ability to control the water temperature it goes from cold to boiling hot we looked for an motion to control the temperature and there was none then when we said that it is not fair to demand we pay extra for the children despite a very clear price proposal we received in advance the management refused to take any responsibility and said it is an issue we need to deal with booking,neg
no elevator had to walk up  flights each time to get to our room,neg
some of the amenities look a bit tired and could do with a spruce up,neg
i didn like the way when we came back from town  of the staff were standing waiting for me and my partnerstraight away they were holding up a sheet of paper saying we broke a thick wooden leaf u leave on the bedthere was no way you could possibly break they pulled up a picture with a crack in the wood said we did not break this repeatedlyafter mind back and forth they so ok we just ask when we were checking out they said we needed to pay for again i said i didn break stand she said well if u dont pay ill have toi still refusedthey are so speak and try to scar you do not stay here horrible staffunfair treatment of customers who were enjoying their stay but they ruined it for us,neg
the bathroom smell a bit damp but are clean would be nice to have a room to hang up clothes to dry,neg
position ok even though not the best  walk to arrive to the main street but there is a bus scuttle to go to the main places based on schedulingpool was not very clean,neg
everything else,neg
for hotel in this price range it is very poor my bathroom was dirty and bath wasn’t working room is very far from the beach pool and beach are a bit small and can get crowded and you have to cross busy road to get there were not really helpful arranging transportation would not recommend or go again same has better option for a lot less,neg
we initially booked a room instead of a villa but the room was not worth the price we paid at all water was dripping all night from the ceiling and we couldn sleep badly maintained so we asked to move to a villa and paid a higher price but it was worth it i would not recommend booking the room in the building,neg
give never experienced a bathroom which made me feel so dirty i often to shower in the pool facilities due to the condition and smell of our bathroom it was a real issue which i should of complained about,neg
it is not recommended for young people who want to have party its more for couplesfamilies,neg
some parts of the hotel showed some minor wear  very minor but noticeable,neg
the pool looks dirty the water from shower would leak out to the other side and flood the sink area,neg
on site facilities are prices for this area  particularly the restaurantbar,neg
was almost completely french menu would have preferred to see more that food on offer also  bath for a continental breakfast seemed excessive in thailand,neg
fitness center was good but could do with a small update,neg
the internet is really slow and takes ages to work sometimes often the sheets were dirty when they had just been put on also wish there was a bit of a better atmosphere round the pool such as some music or something,neg
couldn’t use the top pool unless you were staying in one of the few rooms attached to it given this is the pool that is shown on the webster it’s a little misleading,neg
there are only  things which we believe could be improved further even though the tongs bay is as we already wrote in the other part like paradise the bathroom we stayed in a tongs villa could be improved further made more modern andmaybe also due to the heat it could include a japanesestyle toilet just an idea  the room service which relief on the chef whom and poland restaurant unfortunately has a much more narrow assortment of foods so ordering food via the room service was not as pleasant as going out to those above mentioned restaurant at tongs for example there is nearly no seafood in the room service menu this could be certainly improved for people who stay for longer as we did for  weeks it would be probably preferable if the breakfast selection could change in time for the time of our stay even though there are really manymany option for breakfast the assortment  selection of food was always the same it is one of the best breakfasts which we had at any hotel before we have to emphasize especially the tons of mange we ate which was amazing but during the time of our stay the selection was exactly the same each morning most delicious but constant we were staying at a tongs villa and this villa has a gardenhowever this gardencould be improved further actually we didn once go into it or even open the doors to it it is in a closed area which is not really sunny and a bit depressing the aesthetic and function of this garden could be improved to make it more appealing for the visitors we believe a little fountain in the middle better lighting more open more submit more inviting somehow maybe with a bench and of course antimosquitonets currently there is  view from the garden we could see that through the glassdoor leading to the gardenfrom the restroom,neg
it was not clean all,neg
honestly without nitpicking nothing wrong with the hotel lovely hosts eager to please,neg
the sea was very expensive the food in the restaurant was bad  sugary and bland i felt stuck since it is far away from everything so i felt forced to eat at the hotel restaurant which was bad and go to the hotel sea which was incredibly overpriced,neg
a rat appearing in the room really passed me off,neg
breakfast is really not good enough for what i paid for waitresses are nice but they really did not prepare enough for fully booked status food is limited and low quality,neg
pretty small hotel with some nice villas but the cheap rooms clients affect the average service quality this not fair for the villa clients ill choose the international branded hotels next time for my money,neg
very bad smell on the balcony and bathroomimpossible to enjoy sitting on a balcony such a pity as view is perfect,neg
poor water pressure shower,neg
basic breakfast,neg
have to get bus or taxi to centre it is a bit too far there is a courtesy bus but not very often,neg
the rooms could do with a decoration,neg
the staff went on ridiculous over towels at check out which was unnecessary,neg
not staying longer,neg
iron didn quite make the room cool enough made for a restless start to the night,neg
we dont mind a firm bed but this one was particularly hard water stopped working at one stage however after calling reception they sent someone soon after to fix utmost amenities were good though some furnishing could have used a refresh,neg
breakfast eg the beans have been directly filled from the can,neg
the ancient style airconditioning was facial i did not sleep well for nine nights and went home exhausted iron works for about  hours at a time and then starts blowing hot air i tried for  days to get a room change or get my iron fixed but to no avail they just kept giving me the run around telling me  times each day we are fully booked we will call maintenance,neg
the  or  pools are tiny and shallow and located up the hill wedged between the rooms not beachfront if a good pool is important to you this place is not for you be aware that photo of the the pool on the internet are very deceiving due to the use of a wide angle lens or whatever photography trick,neg
the prices of food and drink are way too expensive and the quality of food did not live up to our expectations,neg
we arrived at  and had to wait over an hour for check after a long day travelling it was a big let down,neg
my first room was a little bit noisy in the morning as there was building work but i switched rooms  it was great the beach furniture needs to be replaced it’s quite old,neg
even if we mentioned before that we are honeymoon couples they did not behave us like that when we entered to our room we saw that it was dirtypillows sheets etc we wanted it to be cleaned immediately they cleaned and they present all the breakfasts as a gift to us we accepted their apology but apart from this the tap water smells so bad but i think in all to same there is the same problem,neg
nothing bad,neg
brilliant location centre of all the nighttime in oh same perfect for younger travellers very expensive bar prices though but that’s to be expected in such a busy location would definitely recommend,neg
the  reception no smile act like slut,neg
shower not stable,neg
old bathroom,neg
room with no view and little dark because the window was covered by hotel signs,neg
my room smelt of milder and the bed was really hard,neg
nothing i could describe we didn like about the property,neg
good moves on to at night but only in that,neg
just had to think for five minutes because there really isn’t anything to improve maybe put a larger selection of spirits behind the bar but that is a minor thing,neg
with the hotel itself  nothing big,neg
only minor things like,neg
the local road noise when in the restaurant small advertising trunks with loud speakers,neg
the inside restaurant was not busy but plenty of local ones,neg
local shopkeepers wanting your attention and custom,neg
everything was good,neg
price for breakfast,neg
breakfast cleaning room,neg
the pictures are huge misleading the rooms were dirty out dated and full of bags we were booked in to stay for longer but ended up leaving early for as a result of finding cockroaches in the bathroom,neg
we stayed in the beachfront pool villa which was absolutely amazing just wish they had built the wall a bit higher so it could be more private as everyone swimming can see,neg
not so close to white beach,neg
small pool area we didn’t struggle to get a bed and it wasn’t crowded but i imagine in high season it is far too small for the number of rooms they have no lift for guests found it sufficient especially as it was included in our room price which was very cheap anyway but there was very little choice at the breakfast buffets,neg
all in one bathshower hard mattress,neg
no real separation in the room between the restroom and the main room,neg
food is a bit expressive relatively to thailand and the restaurant outside the hotel,neg
fitness center was good but could do with a small update,neg
overall very good but a kettle in room would of been nice but for cost of room can complain lock on door not the most secure,neg
renovation done so voice and no easy access to the beach also breakfast delivered to the room not nice,neg
the place was just below an acceptable level of cleanliness the bathroom is small and basic i like a firm bed but this was like sleeping on a sooner table didn find it as noisy at night as people suggest though,neg
some staff especially the ones working nights did not understand nor speak sufficient english which was very frustration at times one guy kept asking us multiple times during breakfast several days in a row to book a by dinner the hotel was arranging kind professional as we were just trying to enjoy our morning meal the vs in our room were pretty much useless as the signal was super weak most of the time and the channels offered were limited,neg
toilet facilities can be improved no those to clean,neg
there is only  mirror for use which is in the bathroom hence if someone is using the bathroom you cannot use a mirror  i would recommend a mirror in the main room as well plus the bathroom being a open area becomes too hot in summer i would recommend a fan in the bathroom,neg
the garden room balconies are right opposite your neighbors so not exactly lounging outside type of stuff but who wants to sit on the balcony when you have the beach breakfast was average and very similar every day but fruit yoghurts eggs and the basis is all you need this is included in your hotel price so definitely worth it,neg
shower didn get warm,neg
too far from everything,neg
our bed was a little squeaky if you made any movement,neg
we travel south east asia constantly,neg
last  months singapore long long tokyo and hi hi seat among ha in in thailand and this hotel overpriced for lack of facilities,neg
no beach to speak of as  guests trying to enjoy  peters of water,neg
i think the price was very high as the hotel was almost empty and our room was definitely not the best one,neg
the swimming pools could do with some tic they were a little bit tired,neg
i wished they had a small house restaurant least for breakfast,neg
room and facilities,neg
the room smelt of must and when you went to bed it felt like the sheets were wet every night,neg
shower was lukewarm at best cold mostly and the same for the bath the water was too cold to have a bath which was a pity,neg
we arranged a scuttle bus from airport but we waited  minutes before the driver got there and as we were paying for this scuttle it was a little annoying,neg
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it,neg
the furniture is quite old  the self had a bad contact and random times when it didn open despite new batteries so we found it safe to keep our passports there,neg
the restaurant is a bit prices for the small portions and regular quality,neg
that hill is too much taxes charged more to drop up hill shower and toilet were broken,neg
no hair dwyer room to no sound air conditioned not working well room design was just too basic bed sheets have some red stains,neg
this place is not on the beach you have to walk out of the building no views of the beach from any room and walk through the restaurant to get to the beach budget room had no windows you can actually see out of the room was ok only had a fan and was quite hot at night there was no room serving for the  days i stayed the restaurant was being refurbished so in a couple of weeks will be good for guests the menu was prices compared to other places the pool looked nice i didn’t swim in it not because it had paint flakes in it just co the beach was nice there is parking to the side of the building but my hire car got scratched staff weren’t overlay friendly,neg
pillow and other staff at bed was horrible,neg
beds not greatly comfortable and very strong smell of disinfectant,neg
the bed was a little too hard for my liking and the iron was noisy,neg
very noisy,neg
shallow water for the beach,neg
i didn like the way the russian manager spoke to me too much attitude no humility,neg
lost my shirt and it want found again it was way too ugly to be stolen but it had sentimental value,neg
shower only had cold water but i hear that normal for a lot of hotels in thailand,neg
room smelled of senate very dark only lamps and no main light,neg
the grm needs more attention with faulty equipment the air conditions are too old and noisy  you need transport to get to reaches and entertainment areas they have a scuttle bus but doesn leave often enough if you have a scootervancar then no problemeverything only minutes away,neg
witness in the restraint with the infinity pool under the star restraint was rude and had a face like thunder,neg
long walk into town beach was dirty,neg
breakfast staff and coffee quality,neg
we booked a cottage suite for myself and a pool cottage for my daughter which was more expensive than mine i would simply stick with the cottage suites i didn think that the pool cottage was any better both of us loved the outdoor bath in both units if you have mobility issues as i do having ms ask for accommodation close to the internal roadway to avoid many stairs to your room electric carts can then transport you anywhere within the grounds,neg
the hotel is in the middle of bars with escort girls the noise insidethe rooms during the night is very high  you can not rest at night thehotel is adjacent to an industrial plant which there noise during they meaning  you not sleep at night and can not rest during the date internet  a big lie  can not surf and work online the hotelmanager claims that she has no obligation to provide internet becauseits free  watch out,neg
food restaurant  male staff service  limited entertainment,neg
be prepared for a lot of walking up and down to get to the lobby and beach this is not recommended for older people the directions are often confusing and it takes some attempts to find the right cottage taxi charges that to take you out of the property to go anywhere else in the centre the resorts own scuttle costs that the service at the beach bar is indifferent and cocktail are nothing to write home about wine choice is also limited and expensive the outdoor tubs only look good in photo breakfast is the same every day and not big variety similar to the restaurant  the male staff particularly need training in customer service,neg
internet is terrible they give you a paper with login and password for  weeks but you need to enter it again and again every  hours plus you need to keep this paper everytime with you because housekeeping is used to clean your room and take this paper away so you need to go downstairs for a new one,neg
stairs if you room number is for than  you will have good exercises many times a day because there is no lift with children they dont give closed rooms,neg
door is very old and you hear everyone who came back home at night generally you hear everything and everyone,neg
breakfast is ok for such a price eggs mouse sausages toasts watermelon pineapple tea and coffee enough but very poor for me,neg
pillows are very big and hard,neg
no russian channels,neg
room service was inconsistent  shower needs to be renovatednot soundproof,neg
one of the mornings breakfast was slow and staff didn have enough english,neg
airconditioning could not be operated normally,neg
beach and sea are awful see through distance in water is only cm,neg
the bungalow,neg
location was a bit secluded but if your going for a relaxing break its perfect,neg
for more absence and bigger choice of food walked to other end of beach to restaurant at sister resort crystal bay yacht club only a few minutes walk would have been nice to be told when we checked in that we could use the facilities at yacht club during our stay found out a few days in nice pool there,neg
some of the bathroomshowers had a strong smell of urine,neg
perhaps a little attention to the pool area its a little tiredifferent,neg
would be nice suited to an adults only resort,neg
shells in the bathroom dusty and rusty bad smell of suffer and humidity hairdryer was burnt air conditioning too loud after we complained we got another room with pleasant smell but still this place needs a takeover,neg
the management who is rude and professional,neg
we were told at the reception that they can prepare breakfast package when we leave the hotel before am breakfast starts at  we requested that breakfast package the day before we leave but nothing happened when we checked outfit would be great if the receptionists look happier and more motivate as compared to the other hotels we stayed my husbands bank card was eaten by at unfortunately we had to leave the very next day he had to call the bank to stop using the card as a receptions told that it happens a lot then please try fix the problem with at,neg
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits,neg
this place is highly overpriced and over rate the pool was infinity but look at chairs because that where the majority of rooms can sit by the pool one small area orange covers everywhere to make sure you dont sit there so inviting tiny room with tiny balcony no privacy with cheap door no pictures on the wall and plastic flowers on the bed cheap thin discoloured towels i was on the rd floor always and stairwell  dark and so ugly no chairs but lots of mosquitoes in the room there is one true picture of  the hotel rooms  but with a wide sense much better hotels in the same area with good standards clean the poor up on the beach front of the chairs was there both days paid  per night and stayed in  a place previous that was full had to move for   it was  star and  excellent stay and the place i moved to really nice  i was told this was a new hotel this surprised me  hate to see it in a year,neg
there are almost no bad things about this property to list the only thing that was a bit annoying was that the shower had almost no hot water on most occasions otherwise everything was very good,neg
some noise during morning hours due to location,neg
the whole place needs maintenance bad smell from the toilet,neg
not much really the white sand extends out to sea so the snorkelling is not great unless you walk up the beach to the rocks a few hundred peters away apart from that we had a perfect stay,neg
there was nothing not to like all amazing,neg
sand at beach pretty coarse,neg
her lines stickiges bad,neg
airconditioning in bedroom was fan only,neg
room was very small,neg
sundry was a complete rip off,neg
bath on the street bath at hotel,neg
