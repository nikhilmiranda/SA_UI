everything at the resort was super expensive so worth the trip to town for meals drinks massage etc 
good value for money the place was very clean too clean to be honest 
trips are expensive through the hotel
expensive for food and drink airport transfer was a rip off
the place is fantastic comfort living and nice environment
very good comfort very clean and well arranged resort great beach and pool nice bungalows
staff was courteous practice and emphatic the food in buffets was fresh and appealing there were also more option provided in the hot and cold beverages compare to the other hotels the room was spacious and had all the amenities and moreover it was kept really clean and tidy for a lawless stay the sooty facility was available with the hotel  hence there was absolutely no need to submit your passport to the outside vendor overall complete value for money
general facility  is great quiet clean
the room was clean and big breakfast was good
they clean your room and change towels and bed every day how pleasant
clear and clean water with various kind of fishes
nice and clean room friendly staff nice location and very close to the beach
the rooms and balcony were awesome service was excellent everyone was so attentive and went out their way to help
the porters and room service staff were really good and helpful always willing to help out with a smile on their face
staff were terrible didn help with parking luggage travelling with a  or old building work going on and no offer to move us staff were very moody
staff always very kind and ready to help
the breakfast was really really good generally the atmosphere at the hotel was superb the staff were very helpful and friendly the room was super big and considering what we paid i really enjoyed the facilities were beyond expectations including the pool and food we came here for our honeymoon and would recommend this for couples
room service food was awful restaurant food was good so maybe we just got room service on a bad night 
the food was great
the food at the restaurant attached is stunning good value and well worth a visit
location noise of airplane
the best place for vacation at simon
great location right off main strip quiet spacious and clean room
the location right on the beach
staff in the reception was trying to charge me more money for a taxi then actual cost its a big shame that hotel staff are thinking how to screw their guests
the privilege card is not what it seems dont go there
overpriced no value for money the pool party is highly operated
overpriced nothing much and this is a strictly a cash business so dont think about paying your balance with your visa card
quiet and spacious accommodation good cocktail
isolated too quiet for us
closed early very quiet after pm around the pool and bar area
very nice and quiet place to chill and to sleep at night beautiful garden
staff very helpful and going the extra mile
customer service from the reception desk was not in keeping with the rest of the hotel
staff always smile and friendly
the staff and the hotel environment were great
the swimming pool is very nice with amazing view 
nice breakfast nice view nice garden
everything was perfect the view from the room come bed nice swimming pool  min walk from the main road
the room was lovely and the view from the balcony i was in the sunrise jacuzzi room was amazing
the wifi was great
internet was only free near reception given the price of this hotel and the modern era should have wifi everywhere and shouldn have to pay extra
the wifi is slow mostly everywhere
internet is terrible they give you a paper with login and password for  weeks but you need to enter it again and again every  hours plus you need to keep this paper everytime with you because housekeeping is used to clean your room and take this paper away so you need to go downstairs for a new one
