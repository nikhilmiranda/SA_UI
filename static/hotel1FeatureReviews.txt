as well the breakfast at the hotel is really expensive
a little expensive for the evening meal but quality of food was good
the food was ok quite expensive but acceptawble
we could move quickly to the beach the pool and the breakfast area and still be close to the main road and all the cheap restaurant the gardens were lovely and the bungalows very comfortable
the location the clean and beautiful beach the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms
location very close to night bazaar general clearness and comfort
comfort of the villaroom garden of the hotel smile of the team the pool area and view breakfast quiet place
its worth paying a bit more for real comfort and quality
the location is amazing with a great view the staff is great very understanding and always have a big smile the fact that almost all staff members had a smile on their face and said hi when ever passed by was simply outstanding customer service something i have not noticed at other hotels from front desk staff to cleaner to serves everyone was pleasant to deal with the hotel is located right on the beach and thankful the water at the beach was pretty warm and it’s clean it’s a great place if you just want to relax lay on the beach and enjoy some nice white noise coming from the sea the hotel is exceptionally clean you can rent a bike directly from the hotel and once again the staff is helpful if you ask them questions about where to go and what to do etc
breakfast was good villa was clean beach front villa ratio is awesome bed is very firm
the bed sheet even when changed was dirty you can see it wasnt cleaned so one time i asked the cleaner to change it one hour after the room was made
the place was very clean rooms were even cleaned daily we originally booked for  nights but extended another  nights all staff were very friendly breakfast at the restaurant was also good and not badly prices for same
the room was looked very large in picturesafter  we get the room we discovered a very very small room the room there were holes in the windows and we got quantities of mosquitoes and insects they stung my two little girls
balcony doors are very secured from outside but can be tricky i locked myself outside on the balcony at the second floorwith no other way than shout to get some help and the staff where always smiling and keen to help anyway they could
the owners of the hotel are exceptional hosts italian hospitality at its best anything a traveller may need they can help
this place was great from check in to our departure the breakfast was excellent and our villa was lovely the staff make it particularly pleasant and went out of their way to help me when i was ill
the beach was a bit rocky and its limited in food choice
nice hotel very clear good pool for relax very good food and nice small pub next to the street with live music only  min walk
only can say that the prices are a little on the high side for thailand however food is amazing but could do with more offers and promotions and better happy hours
the food is not up to the mark nor the service in the restaurant  the breakfast spread could have been better
great location good breakfast very nice pool and bar i also enjoyed that massage
loved everything about our stay the hotel was in a good location breakfast was great with loads of variety the pool was a good size with plenty of sun beds
i have been coming to this hotel many times as we love the location and the beds but the place needs an update please take care of loose electric sockets restaurant tables with broken corners that hurt my child
the hotel is located in a good location a lot of restaurant nearby
noisy full of mosquitoes no hot water only cash payment forgot my taxi arrangement to the airport
to walk to this place is a shame this is a dangerous place not to approach this hotel carefully the end we lost  nights and almost $750
it was as ridiculous as for every km travelled the cost would go up by  bath not even their version of user was very costeffective tourist have no choice but to fork out their money as walking on the roads in oh same is hazardous and the chances of being in an accident are high
the biggest downside of oh same is the transport taxidrivers tuktuk drivers and anyone else exploit tourist by charging a fortune for transportation
request upstairs rooms for privacy  we had deluge terrace not worth the additional money
loud music by guests next door and late night parties am  hotel should be more vigilant about asking guests to respect the quiet hours policy
even the we asked for a quiet room it was right next to the street when they could have have given us a room further away from the traffic noise
the building itself was a beautiful structure it was very quiet with lovely cricket and frog sounds at night and balls grazing in the front yard so picturesque and the animals who live there are amazing especially mary the cat
the hotel is amazing the room we stayed was fabulous with a great view of the ocean the beach is great very calm with few people in the restaurant
the bed is very comfortable staff is very friendly and happy to helps you on any request
room directly opened up to another hotel not the best view
pool area felt like a package holiday no real view from the balcony
i have reserved an ocean view villa and i pay more but i get partial ocean view villa and no one get me my money back
amazing ocean view from room
face towel looks dirty small swimming pool wifi connection is poorsmall fitness room
the internet is really slow and takes ages to work sometimes 
wifi connection was poor and breakfast as well
wifi in my room wasnt very good
