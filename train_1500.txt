full review,pos
since i did separate booking bookingcom asked me for separate reviews i am just going to write the same review hoping it will help people who stay here in their dilemma please note that there is no perfect place neither a place that can be good for everyone it depends on your needs and expectations that is why i highly recommend you to read the full review,pos
staff friendly helpful and speak good englishnot all but the ones in the reception even the cleaner they speak english but its very basic,pos
location for me i considered it a perfect location in chewing the beach at the back side of the hostel is dream and so clean the hostel is about  to  minutes walk from the central mall and the ark beach which i only recommend for the fire show at night but the beach might not be as clean as the one behind p hostelthere are several restaurant massage barber sundry you name it within few minutes walk and a  just right in front of the hostel,pos
rooms they have capsule like rooms and private rooms i stayed in the  person capsule room with window it was really good you have a to a socket to charge your electronics space to put your luggage and a hunger for cloth,pos
common area perfect,pos
lavatorytoilets and shower there are more than enough shower and toilets in this hostel  and they provide liquid body soap and shampoo as well they also give young towel for every  nights of stay,pos
hostel food overall the food price and quality was fair  try the tom sum long and the papa salad ,pos
near by recommendation if you want a westernthai restaurant with good quality food just exit the hostel turn left and walk until you see the hungry wolf on your left,pos
or you can keep walking until you reach the fisherman restaurant and some other street food on your right ,pos
stayed in april,pos
we stayed for  days at the backwater and were very happy with the whole experience the staff were incredibly kind and helpful and any small problems we experienced were very quickly resolved the hotel is new modern and attractively laid out rooms are designed to afford excellent privacy its a quiet and relaxing hotel but easy to get to the beach  mind walk down a private road fisherman village or chewing  min taxi breakfast was good food in the hotel was reasonably prices overall in terms of value for money it was excellent and much better than other nearby hotels in oh same for this money i dont think you could find better on the island,pos
great location,pos
very clean and modern rooms  felt like a value star hotel with a price of half of the four seasons and in the best possible location  we could walk out of our room and be in the fisherman market within  mind  no other hotel could offer anything close,pos
the restaurant next door crystal restaurant was the best  out of  they had really good food to low prices friendly staff my wife is that and even she said that they cooked  delicious,pos
would like to thank all the staff for looking after me and my wife i got hospitalised for  days with a dot and blood clots they run julie to and from hospital every day without charge they visited me with flowers should have stayed  week ended up staying for  weeks they could not have been kinder special thanks to michael,pos
very spacious room and a real big come bed,pos
a very luxurious villa the staff were exceptional we were treated like royalty,pos
the staff location and surroundings were excellent,pos
the room was lovely the bed was so come the pool and loungers were very nice the breakfast was delicious and you can see the sea from the pool,pos
just out off the tourist hut i prefer the quieter accommodation and this place was perfect if you like peace and quietgorgeous sunsetsgood breakfasts and total tranquilitystaff where very friendly and great infinity pool the beachfront cabin i stayed in was perfect i could hear the waves tapping on the shore there is also a great variety off birds so you can sit on your balcony and see the many beautiful colors of these birds and hear them chip there where also cut little squirrel you can even rent a sooner for  bath for a day and there are lots of interesting things to do and see in the lamp area if you have a sooner,pos
beautiful facilities and absolutely spotless staff were lovely and the breakfast buffets was very good great location on the beach but very close to the main street our room was big with a sitting area nice bathroom and good storage space,pos
me and my partner stayed in the penthouse suite for  nights the room was amazing massive room with everything you need and an amazing terrace with stunning views and a jacuzzi however the jacuzzi did not work well and as it was late on the first night we couldn do anything about it and then the next night the sea bath in the room did not work again late at night and it couldn be fixed till the morning so id recommend anyone wishing to use these facilities on a short stay to try them on arrival they did make up for this by providing us a free airport transfer which was nice the pool are was amazing nice big pool with great views and the staff were some of the best were had in a hotel would give this ten out of ten any day and well worth the visit great location as well for visiting fisherman village and some of the trips leaving from north of the island,pos
give stayed a couple of times ideal location for pier to oh ha nan and airport will be back,pos
amazing incredible fantastic beyond our expectations the pictures do not do it justice and do not capture the full beauty of the entire resort we stayed in the honeymoon suite overlooking the ocean with the pool  it was just incredible the staff were beyond helpful with everything  so kind and so accommodation with any and every request top notch service food was delicious and the drinks were incredible the room is gorgeous the beach stunning the location is perfect and the wife was fast we dont have one bad thing to say everything about this place was perfect,pos
the hotel is in a great location it is less than a  minute walk to fisherman village which has restaurant shops markets and spas there is also a family mary mind supermarket across the road which the security guard stops traffic to help you cross over to the staff were lovely always cheerful and very patient even when i noticed some guests being rude to them the maintained their professionalism and did everything they could to make guest experiences wonderful there was one staff member who did not seem to be in a good mood one day but this was the exception to the rule the room itself was large and comfortable with the cleaning staff doing a fantastic job  the food at the hotel was also great the included breakfast had a range of option including toast parties an egg station cereal your and mind pancake they also had a variety of juice and a coffee machine eating at the restaurant for lunch or dinner was also delicious with the staff once again being fantastic we also stayed for one of their market nights on a tuesday where the hotel put on street food style markets on the beach with live entertainment i would definitely recommend this,pos
as for swimming there is a children pool as well as the main pool with huts and lounge chairs pools near the beach and the beach itself also with reclining chairs all pool and beach areas have bar and food service,pos
the hotel also runs a scuttle to chewing but has limited spaces so you need to put your name on the list at reception,pos
room was beautiful very spacious and clean the staff went above and beyond  i travelled with a  year old and they were always playing with him entertaining him also very helpful with organizing things when wanting to get a taxi somewhere never had to wait longer than  minutes,pos

we decided to stay at this property during our  night trip as part of our honeymoon this property was really good and i would highly recommend it was only a  minute journey from the airport which was ideal we often for a room with a plunge pool i thought this was perfect for the few hours i got to spend sunbathing each day as i could do it in the comfort of my own terrace and nip in and out of the pool to cool down and had a beautiful view of the ocean it can be a wee bit extra in cost though so if it’s too much i wouldn’t worry as the pool area is lovely and situated right on the beach and it’s the nicest beach i’ve ever seen the staff at the property were amazing very helpful and friendly the restaurant next to the pool was unreal the food was some of the best i have ever had especially the seafood another thing that is great about this property is the sundry service we have been on our trip for a while and decided to get some stuff washed after this i wanted them to wash all my clothes as they made such a good job the first day it was quite late on by the time i sent the sundry away and i thought i wouldn’t get it back until the following day as that was what i requested it came back around pm the same day  it smelt amazing even my parts were droned and folded this is something i hadn’t requested and the ladies that brought me it were so smile and nice the only thing i would say though is i think they maybe tumble dry the clothes as some of my husband tops were ever so slightly snug but this is something we had already considered prior to sending them so was a risk we took a lot of his shirts are designer ones and need hand washed but it didn’t seem to fade them at all it’s a great location as you can walk along the beach and nip in to most other hotels to their restaurant although we didn’t do this there’s a great excursion shopoffice at the top of the road out of the hotel and slightly to the left about a  min walk,pos

this resort was awesome very clean and beautiful rooms,pos
we booked a sunset suite for the views and weren disappointed  every morning was postcardworthy the beach was also a pleasant surprise as it stretches for a few km on both sides making for very pleasant stroll in the afternoon and evening room service also comes at no additional charge vs eating at the hotel restaurant which is convenient when your feeling lazy for those who appreciate flora  found the hotel was built in a rather noninvasive way so birds and even squirrel are a regular sight on the premises finally the free scuttle to key points around the island is very convenient and saved us a pretty penny for the taxes,pos
location of the place in the heart of the town,pos
and everything is near you,pos

the only thing i like there was a really great breakfast,pos
staff was super nice,pos
the hotel was a beautiful resort in the perfect part of chewing everything from vagrant markets lovely spas and great restaurant were on our footstep but you still had a quiet laid back thailand feel while in the resort,pos
nice hotel in nice that style large room nicely furnished,pos
fantastic staff super helpful and friendly nice cubital style bank beds in forms super clean amazing ac,pos
dark same is very conveniently located in chewing and has lots of excellent bars and restaurant to choose from on your footstep being in chewing and relatively close to ark bar i was expecting to hear loud music but i didn experience this at all the only meal i had at the hotel was breakfast and this was good quality having visited thailand regularly it was above average with a good but limited selection i visited during low season so i can expect them to have everything laid out during this time,pos
the hotel walks right onto the beach and its a nice place to be,pos

liked the chocolate cereal at breakfast,pos
staff were very polite and helpful,pos
nice small pool and in the shade,pos
staff friendly and loved being close to the beach,pos
spacious room with sea view the manager dmitri went out of his way to make our stay special breakfast delivered to the room was extraordinary,pos
great location,pos
great beach,pos
great staff,pos
good location and lovely hotel,pos
wonderful location with delicious food and generally first class service green credentials fully deserved  special little treats for our honeymoon were a nice touch and the cottage so private clothing was entirely optional,pos
great staff and pool comfortable stay highly recommend and will return for my next stay,pos
great room with a great private pool very good for a family with older children very good breakfast and very good restaurant and room service very nice beach excellent thanks sea treatments,pos
the room was extremely dark even when i switched a room and i wanted something with more light the shower is open no door so should be taken into consideration no plugs next to the bed need a bit of renovation in the rooms but overall good not close to the chewing a taxi is  bath the ac stopped working  times in my first night but they changed my room afterwards,neg
not a good vice all had to pay for hanging out in the poolarea didn felt welcomed at all really bad service at the restaurant rude staff,neg
the room smelled funny no room service,neg
pillow was too soft,neg
breakfast could be little bit better,neg
a woman of staff is quite rude,neg
partly the service concerning housekeeping was slow the other room in the villa was without the toilet for two days resident manager was only interested in german speaking customers,neg
the first rooms given to us on the top floor had gaps between the windows and doors easy for mosquitoes to get in it was quickly resolved when ask staff if we could have another room there was no problem is was resolved immediately they put us in a lovely room we did have a lovely stay there,neg
almost everything i likely  price of the food bit expensive but there are enough restaurant and bars around the hotel,neg
the location was noisy at nighttime  i think there might be a bar close by that plays music and as it is a tent with no solid walls you could hear noise very easily this is my only complaint though and not something that is the resorts fault but maybe if earplugs were provided it would help everything else was perfect,neg
breakfast location,neg
bathroom looked dated but still worked fine,neg
ergot a you alert,neg
bed want the best the pool was very basic and there were only news channels in english on the to  no moves no cable channels no smart to option at all in no internet conductivity via the to  netflix etc,neg
the only con was that our bedroom window which was pretty much half of a wall faced the only area for hotel parking it took away some privacy but people only marked there at night during our stay,neg
the property itself is a bit old and underwhelming  pool is small and for the price you pay you don’t feel the luxury of a five star establishment would not recommend for solo travelers as it’s mostly a family resort kiss everywhere,neg
shocking management of staff obviously no respect or knowledge for that culture and what motivate them staff were fabulous,neg
the room had tiny ants all over we have stayed in many places in the to sang area and have never experienced this unfortunately the room size staff and location were all great but this was a major downside for us,neg
bed not that come two singles pushed together although don’t expect room to be turned over daily would be nice to get the bathroom bin emptied daily due to the fact no waste paper can be thrown in toilet,neg
terrible service in front desk as if they were offended all time,neg
us  buffets without water but need to buy wimmimb pool without water but need to buy,neg
dirty cup during breakfast,neg
 min for a sandwich in international restaurant for dinner when not busy at all as we are the only guest,neg
rumors and loud music until late night,neg
room is quite small and not much room for balfour room was on the st floor closest to reception which meant it was a bit loud in the mornings,neg
the staff did not speak at all very unfriendly the pool area did not serve drinks at all very poor,neg
sea looked not very clean nobody was swimming in the sea water temperature  everybody was using the fantastic pool,neg
it s hard to find out something wrong with this resort to be extremely perfectionist i would say the bedroom clearness can be gently improved,neg
this apt need definitely reconstruction old furniture old kitchen only with few staff need to buy more plates cutlery beach is written as m away but in fact is ca m because you need to go around its not direct access but it was fine for us min walk with kiss,neg
maybe a pool bar would be good,neg
room was a lot smaller than it looked but did the job,neg
few mosquitoes in the room from where all windows had been left open before we arrived,neg
the hotel was especially hilly you have to be strong and healthy to walk up and down the hill to get to your room the beach was very rocky no one goes there the restaurant is ok but food was way too expensive they dont have too many choice for you we also couldn find any stores or places to eat around the hotel we ended up renting a car,neg
staff is unfriendly,neg
desk and bench top are full of ants,neg
iron is not working,neg
terrible house keeping,neg
not so well looked after,neg
overall not great experience with the quality of the service,neg
from the person showing you the room entering with his shoes on unheard of in thailand to our request for a baby bed request that was made when making the booking and several times within the few hours after we arrived that finally got taken into account after our baby was asleep to the very complicated check out process where we were asked to pay for a relatives expenses who was saying in another room it took  minutes for them to figure out that it was their mistake,neg
our room door was not closing properly when we arrived so we had a terrible mosquito spraying smell in the bedroom the spray they used for the garden they tried to cover the smell with essential oil which made it even worst overall probably one of the poorest hotel service we ever got,neg
the bed we kept on hitting our ships with the platform the mattress is on we saw other people with black and blue also shower towels very old some times they really need replacement,neg
nothing i disliked,neg
really nothing bad to say here well done if i had to pick something its a little bit of a tree to the main road from the resort but i guess that the payoff for beachfront ocean views but with looters bites and taxes this is still not an issue,neg
pool staff member would simply ignore guest and often rude even asking for a towel was not pleasant in addition they require a bath deposit for towels despite being a hotel guest the internet was podgy at best and the balcony lights is generally controlled and off only after pm you will find it hard to sleep rooms also look into each other and no privacy,neg
poor response to maintenance calls re room jacuzzi,neg
breakfast is not worth such an hotel standard,neg
no enough choice no real fruit juice batteries not fresh very disappointed by it,neg
everything was very good except the freshness of the fruits at the breakfast the noise in the corridor in the morning and the iron that we cannot manage,neg
always noisy in the rooms hard to sleep,neg
a bit overpriced for the service they provided they are serving really tactless coffee for breakfast forcing you to order a proper one at the bar,neg
the grm closes at  the swimming pool closes at  what is the reason behind no one could answer,neg
service on the beach and pool side,neg
staff could have been more friendly in a quiet area,neg
the building doesn have a lift so be prepared to do some heavy lifting if you are on the upper floors the wife connection was not that fast in the premises making even the payment of the hotel by card not possible when we arrived thankful worked the nd day but i would advise having cash with you just in case the breakfast included only instant coffee which was a bit disappointing,neg
the hotel needs to do more lightning around the hotel as it is too dark for people to move around at night,neg
too many wizards around,neg
the hotels restaurant is prices sometimes  times more expensive than lamaichaweng restaurant,neg
mosquitoes  many of them inside the rooms and all around,neg
a rat appearing in the room really passed me off,neg
breakfast is really not good enough for what i paid for waitresses are nice but they really did not prepare enough for fully booked status food is limited and low quality,neg
pretty small hotel with some nice villas but the cheap rooms clients affect the average service quality this not fair for the villa clients ill choose the international branded hotels next time for my money,neg
breakfast was not great no buffets not much variety would have liked some that option,neg
the bathroom was a potential hazard the shower head sprayed water all over the floor,neg
absolutely perfect for the value we played,neg
too many reckon,neg
the door to the hut didn’t quite fit the doorframe so we ended up having to put a towel underneath to keep out bags but it seemed to work the dining area is open and attracts flies constantly which was a bit annoying but the view made up for it the resort is situated right at the end of the bay and a long walk from the main area of lamp if you get a taxi back then insist on them using the peter as most drivers try charge  the whereas with the peter it was  the overall a very nice stay at lamp bay view,neg
king size bed was connected by two small one and it is unevenroom clean was not in time  asked for airport service while check out but they forgot to tell to the driver which caused waiting at reception more than ten minutes until i asked again when can we leave,neg
charged us for complimentary water,neg
needed more air conditioning in the always,neg
they didn change the towels and sheets between the days,neg
the location is quite far from the main attractions and does not have access to the beach also there isn much food choice in the hotel itself,neg
a lot of construction bad beach dirty spot for the sea,neg
not much choice for hall food,neg
some broken sun are,neg
the amenities,neg
small roomstrange bed with concrete sides,neg
i didn had a great view no balcony but in the end of the day you just there to leave your bags and to sleep in,neg
the only thing i can say is the lights at night could be brighter,neg
staff not guest tormented too often talking between themselves rooms need serious upgrade restaurant very disorganised no lantern or candle on table to be able to see food pictures in menu not what you get for your order way over prices food,neg
small and not enough space to relax around pool or beach,neg
they wanted to charge us for the sundry bag fortunately the manager told not to,neg
their is no hermetic doors you can hear if someone is speaking at the halfway,neg
the facilities were a bit dated and due for a takeover no kayaks available restaurant expensive,neg
jellyfish stung a tourist and i caught one jellyfish right next to my children,neg
the hotel is very old and dated  any repairs or maintenance that have been done look like they have been done by a child  i was there for  nights but due to sickness i only had one breakfast  it was very cheap indeed and only watered to the asia market  the gardens and pathway need a complete overhauled,neg
rooms were very old sheet were torn driver from airport had issues,neg
a bit disappointed that the daubed mattress at the beach pool was a little warm down and had spots on it but the staff lay beachtowels on top of its it want that bad,neg
staff are the best take care off everything,neg
shower lacked pressure there were a few hours without water in the hotel but they did not let us know ahead of time,neg
there were drainage issues in the shower,neg
the pillows were too high therefore uncomfortable,neg
the hotel is located far away from the city center which makes it a bit uncomfortable if you are willing to find lots of restaurant and shops,neg
cleanliness is an issue the house keeping staff is weak and doesn do justice to the place overall maintenance is very weak make sure that you call the staff and tell them that  the rooms and bathroom need to be cleaned properly the ac was not working which they fixed a few lights were not working in the room the baby cot provided was broken so we didn use it,neg
the resort is very hilly and i dont  recommend it for older people with knee issues although they do have a buggy service till pm,neg
it was a bit prices,neg
the room was out dated,neg
can be noisy from the bar across from the hotel til around  or  at night,neg
apartment was lovely but getting a bit tired the beds were too hard,neg
to get working electricity you must leave access card in capsule,neg
you will need to take a taxicarservice if you want to go anywhere it is a a way to go to get to other restaurant and the nighttime of oh same  but that may be just why you chose this resort the water is to shallow for swimming on the beach but the pools are nice,neg
rooms the restaurant  and being on the flight path,neg
the extra beds in the rooms agent really suited for adults so if you travel with a group of  just book  rooms,neg
a lot of mosquitoes outside at night,neg
rooms with city view just no have sunlight due to blocked windows by advertisement from outside old and not at good condition at all,neg
if you stay there ask for rooms on rd floor with mountain view its much more better,neg
the breakfast was limited,neg
i didn’t like the insects every where my opinion is to remove all the trees and grass because who will com to hotel doesn’t need thatand all people com’s for beach not to stay close to the trees and grass etc,neg
mosquitoes,neg
parking area not much cable to inside didn’t work well,neg
really tourist plenty of families and you cannot even tell the difference between staying here or in another tourist resort in another part of the world,neg
standard room is really terrible,neg
room service had european food on menu when ordered answer we only have that food,neg
dont have pool and its not the best beach of oh same,neg
everything was brilliant there no faults,neg
take me back,neg
everything was really excellent in the future it would be nice if the hotel could provide some beds on the nearby beach,neg
i didn like the premier room bathroom how its semi open i got attacked by mosquitoes every night,neg
some parts of the hotel showed some minor wear  very minor but noticeable,neg
the behaviour of the girl with the white hair who welcomed us she want so friendly she was arrogant,neg
the cocktail,neg
soap comb etc the usual little things in bathroom they were not provided,neg
the amenities and size of room need to be upgrade,neg
the restaurant is insanely overpriced we got a soup for  bath and it was tiny still very hungry not good,neg
i liked everything about this propertythe only slight negative is that the beach does have lots of shellspebbles and old coral if you wade bit deeper so you will need water shoes i want fussed about this though kiss will have fun though with the variety of beautiful shells,neg
we had some problems locking our door but the staff quickly assisted us with this and had it fixedalthough amazing the hotel is expensive for the area,neg
i loved everything there could not fault it at all,neg
the pillows were too hard and too thick,neg
the room was very small beach not suitable for swimming the water was not clean,neg
the hill side location also means that the resort is not very suitable for people who need a pray a wheelchair or have mobility issues the fairly simple breakfast is over prices at  bath,neg
some of the reception staff were abrupt and came across as a bit rude not a good area  far away from main places,neg
the staff was horrible and took an eternity before they gave you any help once they gave you service it was really floppy,neg
the property is run down potentially could be nice,neg
the location is far from chewing night life but its quite good if you prefer quite area,neg
our bedroom doors allowed many mosquitoes into our room overnight we had our room sprayed by staff daily but overnight mosquitoes would get through the gaps up to cm around parts of doors and mm window gaps and we counted eighteen mosquitoes in room next morning and bites on our arms and body we had to buy our own surface spray to apply to all gaps and this stopped mosquitoes getting in,neg
the room was compact with hardly any room around the bed expected more for the price of room,neg
room was way too warm even with the air con on give stayed in loads of hotels here in thailand and this was the least favourite also the shower had only got steaming hot water,neg
the rent for kitchenequipment was way to high  th or day we had the honeymoon villa and could feel a little alone when it want any neighbours but no problem at all,neg
the bathroom was very small and the pictures on booking did not reflect our real bathroom,neg
some of the facilities need a little rendering and  beach towel per person per day is a little inconvenient,neg
the property is really far from main places the only way to get to them was renting a car or ordering a taxi from the hotel which was expensive,neg
there were ants in the room that bit,neg
the to didn work properly and they were unable to fix it,neg
the place is a little dated for the money they are asking very average breakfast,neg
staff at reception are nice but lack enthusiasm there is one girl cannot remember her name who does not have friendly client interactions  i have been at this hotel a few times and she is always the same she is blunt doesn smile and the feeling is she just wants to get rid of you,neg
didn find the front office staff very helpful or friendly everything seemed an issue for them,neg
for the price we paid the resort missed the marked it was nice and comfortable but the finer points were missing granted it was off season when we visited so that may be part of the explanation however the experience was pretty average or the amount we paid the location is about  minutes from fisherman village which is beautiful although tourist a major shopping complexarea is just slightly further,neg
rooms were average,neg
floors were not cleaned,neg
the property is in real need of a thorough cleaning and upbraiding,neg
suciedad de la play,neg
no complaints at all,neg
it would have been great if the hotel offered a began menu we had  began in our party of  people  also if the hotel was more environmental friendly especially towards the protection of the ocean  and just as a suggestion they could banish all single use plastic such as plastic straw and either offer bamboo straw or offer metal straw for sale,neg
nothing it was perfect,neg
klimaanlage war last,neg
breakfast only watered for signs,neg
hotel too far away from beach,neg
no courtesy driver to beach  had to wait hour,neg
there were never any beach or pool sunbeam as they were always reserved hotel was overrun by german speakers,neg
i hope from the management of the hotel to take care about muslin people when they stay in the hotel as we can eat ham or pork beef and its happen with me as i dont know that ham its same pork,neg
some toiletries  were not therepool m cm deepattentiveness staff,neg
the hotel scuttle from the airport was only  mind and because i booked through bookingscom the hotel charged  bath for the transfer which is quite expensive considering the hotel room was  bath the hotel is very near to the airport which made it convenient for me because i only spent one night but it is directly under the flight path,neg
the ac is very old and noisy the bed is too hard poor english for room service,neg
rooms were comfortable but need an upgrade in the bathroom,neg
i don’t have much bad to say as such only that on the first night and third there were power cuts but this was the whole island so couldn’t be helped it just meant the emergency lights came on in the bedroom and you couldn’t get them off which wasn’t ideal for sleeping we were initially in a villa at ground level but asked to be moved after the first night due to the smell of senate sadly this is something that fingers throughout most of thailand the senate systems are just not great we were very kindly moved to a villa up high that smelt amazing and had a better view so couldn’t fault the staff for quickly resolving our issue the only other thing i would say is the happy hour cocktail weren’t great but i’m probably a bit of a drink snow to be fair they just weren’t strong enough for me however i tried the long island ice tea from the normal cocktail menu and it was amazing  definitely enough alcohol in that,neg
staff not helpful breakfast very poor location was on a very busy road with no pavement restaurant and food and  drink services finished at pm and sending machine empty noise from that boxing stadium next door,neg
two small negative points,neg
no airportpickup can be organized or only during reception opening hours from amp,neg
show head fixation is too low even for me measuring mm,neg
only a writing desk chair in room no arm chair for watching to  the shower plunging on and and off switches are really fiddle  a few strands of hair over the floor  not complete privacy with properties close and overlooking one another,neg
hilly site  beachfront terrible  door and saying very old  maintenance and upgrade needed around grounds and gardens very overpriced,neg
the prices for the house cocktail and dinners are very expensive so rather go to the beach restaurant next door where you can get great value the same food for a quarter of the price,neg
too small breakfast room,neg
the beds were uncomfortable in the rooms and the sun loungers too,neg
i didn like the view from the balcony overlooking a building with security  too noisy for us too,neg
grm is small,neg
if i was to be super pick the cleaner forgot to replace my hand hand towels on one day  the main pool was pretty busy,neg
very come room is nice and big stuff are very kindly good location and nice beach swimming pool,neg
the first two days they had toilet paper and suddenly we had to pay  bath,neg
very dated property very large reckon moving about dogs fighting mosquitoes biting no mosquito repellent no cable to very poor snacks i would rate it  stars,neg
beautiful boutique hotel with amazing views from the rooftop pool best location in the village,neg
water in the beach was dirty,neg
the food could have been better,neg
scuttle service stopped at pm  would have been nice to have a later one so you could go out more easily in the evening and also wife in the lobby want amazing,neg
ac in room could be quieter,neg
sure some rooms need dating but they are clean and large with everything you need and its meaningless when you have the wonderful location and super staff,neg
massage only till pm  min walking to the beach but they give you a one way ride better to be at an hotel direct on the beach and pay small extra amount of money every day we had to pay money to rent bed chair on the beach and many hotels accept only their customers,neg
the one slight downside with it being a secluded beach resort is the  minute walk to the grocer store and the  minute walk to local restaurant and shops,neg
i was afraid about the road in front of the hotel,neg
it was ok during the low season but i dont know about high season but better that i was excepted too the reception is a little to dark and sometimes missing some light during the night,neg
staff should be more helpful taxi prices are clot higher if you ask at the reception and receptions drives you with her personal car used it only once and figured,neg
the paths road from the rooms down to the main road were very steep the main strip of chewing beach is too far away to walk to if you are accompanied by lazy children  need to hop on a pick up taxi for  minutes to get there that each rent some looters,neg
the shower area in the bathroom is too small with little water coming the swimming  pool in the mountain hotel and you need every time to go by car the bed sheetsblanket and towels are too old and  need to add more bed cover and fellows specially if you open the air conditioned,neg
can fault much at all was overall good,neg
strange that in our bathroom the water of the shower leads straight on the ground instead of connected to the skewers,neg
reception staff worst,neg
road separates bungalows and property,neg
property in take off and landing flight paths of airport,neg
no balcony shower  fitting broken,neg
stairs lots of,neg
we booked a room with inside bed and got two single bed instead it took  night  to get us a solutionthe restaurant at the hotel is so bad i get my dish  after  min and my boyfriend got his  hour after my dish was served the food is very expensive like  time more then other restaurant in the area and the hotel is very far from any restaurant so you have to buy therethey say they have scuttle services but if there is no minimum people that booked for the scuttle they will cancel,neg
the pool is very nice but not enough lounge chairs for everyone,neg
a bit expensive although chewing in general is expensive,neg
mosquitoes,neg
the bed was not very comfortable the mattress was very hard and the pillows were too high giving me and my girlfriend both neck ache not enough loungers around the pool if that’s where you wanted to be isn’t too much of a problem as it is located a stones throw away from the beach,neg
the shower is not private so if your travelling with kiss its a bit problematical they did hang a curtain though at our request the toilet door is not aright and the smell escapes there was a smell of dampness in the room,neg
no close by facilities,neg
hotel was isolated from the main part of town and road to get to hotel could be improved,neg
price of drinks could have been better,neg
the pool was only sunny until  pm,neg
iron in the bedrooms are a little loud,neg
actually it was my rd time to stay in this place the previous two was amazing i really liked the beautiful garden the good location friendly staff and more at this time we got a room at the groundfloor the windows faced to the mess corner of the garden the room was a bit dark and not as comfortable as the rooms on the upper floors there was a noisy compression next to the room too i think this room should be costs less however the other rooms have more than suitable prices,neg
there was very little space to put any clothes no chest of drawers and very limited hanging space,neg
ideally we would have liked the pool near the beach rather at the opposite end of the hotel maybe this should be mentioned in literature,neg
barrestaurant poor especially for breakfast wife very bad both need to be improved,neg
could do with a few more paradol for sun longer and maybe some karay or paddle board for guest use,neg
no rooms for smokers,neg
repairs next door,neg
the noise from one room to another the walls are thin and even if they brush the teeth you can hear themrecommdation put to the windows mosquito net,neg
the restaurant does have coffee and coronet water but no began healthy option either fried or meat  it is ok though because across the street is an amazing indian restaurant,neg
the shared door in our room provided little induration  a lot of noise from the neighbouring room creaking floor boards and foot steps on stairs etc a pretty location and balcony though,neg
found dirty sheets with granular and various seeds,neg
cost of taxi getting there from the airport very expensive,neg
the room was a long walk from reception since i have a health condition i would have liked to know that heading in,neg
i hope from the management of the hotel to take care about muslin people when they stay in the hotel as we can eat ham or pork beef and its happen with me as i dont know that ham its same pork,neg
no beach near,neg
i asked the manager named anna who was at front desk for extra milk cachets as we drink a lot of tea but she wouldn give me more and told me to go to  eleven over a few that bath seriously anna,neg
i went to ask one of the receptionists named ladawan who was on a personal call a few questions she stopped her call answered two of my few questions and when i went to ask my final question she rudely pointed to her mobile phone gave me a dirty look and returned to her personal phone call,neg
the pool is not open after pm,neg
i caught tinel from the shower floor which clearly needs to be disinfected rrrr and my wife really didn appreciate the cockroaches that somehow made their way into the bathroom each night morning,neg
i think the bed in the room we stayed needs some repair as it squeaked knocked loudly and moved too much we found out as were on our honeymoon hata,neg
too many stairs,neg
first two days we had wind towards the beach it was very wavy and not suitable for swimming the beds are not comfortable the shower should be changed,neg
the staff was not really welcoming and did not help us very well when we needed it the hotel has a scuttle service to chewing beach but just  times a day and you have to come back by yourself when you do not take the free scuttle and you ask for a taxi they call their own taxi the taxi was more expensive than a normal taxi,neg
the bathroom is a wet room and can smell damp at times,neg
rooms are clean but the whole place is in need of some tic,neg
just needs a bit of a reap mostly with the pool area,neg
a few miles from chewing town but it often goes tuktuk we stayed at the top of the pool area which is far up be sure to have a moved or my hard beds sound ac and very bad pressure in the shower friendly staff,neg
misleading advertising as being a beach front hotel however you need to cross a very busy road to get to the beach,neg
the only thing that disappointed us was the by we had higher expectations especially of the meat but it was dry and seasoned too hot no offer accept fruit and brown  for deserts while you lay down a large amount for  people there was a fire show during dinner which was really great,neg
die matratze war extreme hart,neg
the forms were smell and hot i upgrade to a private room which was much better,neg
speed of wife,neg
the facilities needs a bit of refurbishment,neg
a bit far from town but depends on what you are looking for whether to consider that a problem plenty of rides into town but a bit price in evening not that many option for dinner around but perhaps that because of the season july,neg
air conditioned sufficient,neg
wish they could have a few more option in the breakfast buffets for the vegetarian,neg
i stayed here with my girlfriend we are in our s and the majority of people that stayed here are in the s  dont come here if you are looking to meet other young people location to chewing is about  mind away on a sooner can be a bit of a haste if you are going out most nights,neg
lo staff a did pock pessimo ti trata male è scores a qualsiasi tea richest come per esempio un semple telefonata ad un agents del post per organizzare un tour o quand si è trattato di cambiare la camera dato the i avevano dato un bungalow beach front con in fiance  tocchi well’immondizia non vi rico l’odor l’union the si saliva è il ragazzo well reception not the a il turn di note the è motto cordial la ragazza the c’è di giorno dovrebbe proprio cambiare labor outre a non paper been l angles è maleducata e indisponentecolazione horrible pulizia well camera e arredamento terribilethe staff is unkind and not helpful as i ask to call a local agent to organize a trip to oh to and the girl at the reception was disappointed and treat me bad as well as i asked to change our bungalow cause there were  garage bags near our room an the smell was awful the only nice receptions was not he was very kind and professional but he works just during the night the receptions of the day doesn’t speak english properly she is rude and professional i think she has to change her jobbreakfast was horrible and the cleaning in the room and also the furniture were terrible too,neg
the  to true visions did not work after the first day  i did not go to watch to that for sure but in the evening before bed its nice to relax and watch a bit of to  the staff did try and fix it and make a call to true but being a long weekend in thailand it was never going to be fixed  the staff did offer me a complimentary breakfast on my last day which was a nice gesture,neg
not enough chairs at the poolnot enough towels at the poolpool experience was very poor as could not get a chair or a towel to enjoy swimming very upset about this,neg
staff in lobby cafe do not fix order and table number so  times of  they asked to pay wrong order  little english two times they forgot orders at all being nice no assistance with baggage,neg
better to go away m for swimming without sharp rocks,neg
pool villas are a bit expensive,neg
too far to go central mall menu maybe can input no pork for muslin,neg
the restaurant food had just little taste if you not order a currythe taxi prices from the hotel are far to high just walk to the street and ask for one that drives bu,neg
the bungalows are old a lot of humidity the furniture is old too opt for superior rooms they are far better and newer,neg

the iron in the bedroom noise was a bit louder than what we are used t,neg
the location as you need to walk a bit by the main road or tuktuk to reach lamp beach center a bit hard mattress,neg
restaurant staff was very grumpy and didn look like they wanted to be there  there was lots of greeley which was great to look at but also meant clot of mosquitoes,neg
the rooms furniture is very old and the toilet was literally soaked when you have a shower,neg
a little out of the way,neg
it picking  but the coffee at breakfast is terrible and you cannot ask for proper coffee to be made,neg
and the free water provided every day by the hotel is horrible,neg
that about it i did say that was nitpicking,neg
wife was not working in our room the beach and sea was surprisingly dirty compared to our last stay in this resort  years ago also there was a warning about oil stain we were not allowed to enter the sea but we did anyway,neg
only  key per room is not very helpful you will hear all the plans departing from the airport during the day a massage at the beach in front of the hotel was quite bad,neg
breakfast is really not bad at all fruits have flies and there not placed in a cold area so they smell choice is very limited and the breakfast is taken above a corner of the beach with lots of stones and the seaweeds smell really bad,neg
i thought the hotel was on the beach instead its above a the sea but there are many rocks under and you have no sunbeam from the hotel directly on the beach and the stones are covered in seaweeds that smell quite a lot,neg
some staff are really nice but others are not really trying to make things any easier,neg
only internet is problematical not stable also restaurant prices are too expensive  double of nearby restaurant,neg
it is a little way away from restaurant and local shops   facilities a bit tired needs refurbishing,neg
there was a set time for breakfast i was ill during my stay and dmitri was kind enough to make me omelet for my stomach very,neg
check in war problematisch,neg
beware there are thieves in the hotel we stayed there for three nights from jan th on the rd day our locked password want working after got it open by the hotel we found that  is missing from there the hotel didn even care to respond to our request for investigation  wife doesn work staffs are not very friendly,neg
no complaints apart from some noisy  harddrinking slaves,neg
bit more expensive then otherhotel on chewing expensive hotel restaurant,neg
leaving this wonderful place called tongs bay,neg
small hotel not very clean  the hotel has aloud air condition  that makes a lot of noise  but not cooling the room the key of the room is big and if you loose it you have to pay clot the hotel give you towels but for a missing towel they charge  bateven if they took it when they clean the room the breakfast is very all and not taste and at  you can not find any food even if it should finished at  not recommend hotel,neg
it is far from center,neg
rooms had a bit of an odor,neg
nothing in particular,neg
staff at reception very impolite no smile no say hello very bad,neg
breakfast,neg
communication with staffs difficult as they dont speak or understand english,neg
no privacy although my booking was for private two bedrooms villa,neg
only one restaurant in the hotel,neg
only one bathroom in two bedrooms villa,neg
access to the property is difficult and it is dangerous to walk outside the property,neg
rooms are a bit small food was average there were issues with the water supply not able to take a shower for one day of our visit,neg
the cheapest rooms have very tiny windows on the side so you feel like there is no windows at all i had to pay  the per night for an upgrade to room with normal window,neg
sometimes the order in the restaurant was misplaced chicken instead of shrimp or different icecream,neg
not enough choice for restaurant in the hotel no lobby bar or entertainment in the evening which is kind of boring the hotel is a long ways from all of the shops and main beach the hotel beach was quiet no one selling anything the main reaches were far only way to get there is taxi which is expensive,neg
couldn fault anything about our stay,neg
service from hotel reception was the worst i have ever received,neg
very minor detail the toilet was in an awkward position i had to avoid hitting my head on the wall in front,neg
i wish the staff were more understanding after we had an accident because the rakes in one of the bites they rented us stopped working properly asking for a deposit to cover damages while one of the guests is about to go into surgery is out of order,neg
we stayed there on two separate occasions the second time was for just a single night in order to catch an early flight the maintenance for that room was not great small stuff which adds up,neg
staff dont seem to work alongside bookingcom as when we arrived they had no indication of our reservation and did not have a room for us this caused a lot of distress as we arrived late at night thankful they made room for us but only for one night even though we had booked for two staff said they would check if there was space for us but seemed to find it amusing that they had none and we had to leave  they weren very helpful or considerate in the slightest overall wouldn stay again,neg
the veranda looked onto a block wall unit s  other units faced onto lovely tropical gardens,neg
sons rooms although very clean needs to be updated,neg
the breakfast is very nice but it would be great to have more option variety as there are not that many alternatives nearby,neg
the place was undergoing construction beach area was filthy building works everywhere dangerous having to walk through a construction site daily when construction is finished it will be lovely,neg
there were not many option for nice activities no snorkelling equipment and there isn much to explore at a walking distance,neg
it is a family friendly resort so be prepared for lots of kiss at the pool during the day,neg
the water didn work well the resort needed a restructuring its too old,neg
bed sheets were dirty we asked to change them the new ones were also dirty we asked again they came to check if this was correct and finally changed them with clean sheets lot of time wasted smell bathroomdoor of the balcony didn close they came to repair it on top of above mentioned we didn enjoy our stay in this hotel,neg
other guests that have no respect children in the pool   his after it was closed to be respectful to the rooms at the pool,neg
staff doesn speak english,neg
no manager on site,neg
iron rushed and noisy,neg
no hot water,neg
waist of money,neg
low water pressure on bathroom,neg
the room needed some renovation,neg
very small pool didn use at all there a big contrast between the old style and new style bungalows we were given a classic bungalow but we then walked by modern bungalows that were newly renovated big difference also it is a half hour walk maybe from lamp town centre a bike is needed,neg
staff was fine didn’t receive too many smiles from them and didn’t really make us smile either but they weren’t rude or anything not the most pleasant or welcoming though but the guns helping carry baggage did a great job doing so especially in the pouring rain our room was very far back from the hotel entrance so it took  minutes for us to walk to the restaurantbeach rooms in the back also were closes to the highway so you can hear some street noise didn’t keep us up at night and i barely noticed my husband did though and if we’re being pick the lighting in the bathroom is bright and aggressive,neg
of of 때문에 그런가 개미같은 애들이 of 안에도 있더라구요 of 이거는 구조상 of 수밖에 of 것 of 그리고 of 지나치게 of 무서워해서 그렇지 괜찮은 수준입니다,neg
bathroom lighting a little too dim,neg
not much to be honest,neg
limit choice of breakfast,neg
it was a little bit out of the way so taxes were quite expensive if you wanted to leave the resort,neg
the bed could have been more come,neg
there is an airport just behind the fence and landing airplane are flying just over the resort the first airplane arrives at around am and it is extremely loud,neg
it needs an investment in modeling and maintenance,neg
no view from most rooms but we were never there anyway,neg
room didn smell so good shower gets entire bathroom wet,neg
can’t think of anything,neg
nothing except i wanted to have my room earlier around  pm but could not however it is the season  totally understandable of the situation,neg
the internet is very slow and you have to login every time you wanted to use it it can be a bit loud during the night because of the loud music from the beach bars,neg
breakfast was fairly average,neg
only the beachfront apartments are modern others a bit dated by fine,neg
no air in reception and breakfast room,neg
reception tidings should be open till  pm at least,neg
the royal suite room we stayed in was dated and need of refurbishment food in resort restaurant was very average staff could have more genuine with happy service,neg
my triple room is situated at th floor firing climb up the stairs,neg
rumors la note  con  spite sonya rispetto,neg
a bit far from town center,neg
nothing  star everything,neg
at the day of arrival the room was quite dusty and dirty upon request it got cleaned the pool was a bit dirty too and seemed not to be used by anybody,neg
breakfast was not that great,neg
rooms needed update,neg
the food in the restaurant was overpriced,neg
there was no mosquito net and room was small and we had power cuts every time we took a shower cafe not that great really,neg
rooms a little dark,neg
when pushing my toller in strolled around the resort had to lift the strolled up and down small steps several times ended up letting toller walkrun around most of the time in resort hope resort add camps next to steps to make place more strolled friendly,neg
compared to restaurant in the area the food was expensive but nice,neg
the cleaning stuff,neg
the ac unit had a little problem the first  days some water was leaking when it was on for too long but it stopped afterthe bed might be a little too hard for some people,neg
airport really close hotel right on the airplane way they fly just above the hotel lot of noise from am ok for a short stay,neg
the only downside which the hotel can’t control was that the water in the sea was a bit dirty which i’m finding a lot of the reaches are in thailand was even worse because we had some bad weather,neg
took awhile for the hot water in the shower to come through,neg
the beach could have been a little cleaner but it was mostly natural debris so not really a problem,neg
there was some problem and we didn have hot matter for a day,neg
the grounds and rooms need a little more attention,neg
the fact it had an issue with electricity and we were expected to walk up unit stairs to our dark room as part of the hotel had a power cut for hours during the evening and night,neg
when i took issue with reception about how safe i felt and how unhappy i was they did in fairness move me to another room but this wasn’t an offer they made initially,neg
there was a problem with the plunging in our first room causing us to have no hot water  once it was obvious that it was not going to be a quick fix the staff quickly moved us to a new room  thanks,neg
we are double charge and the refund is still on the progress at this moment when i am doing the rating for them,neg
i would increase the scuttle times and the scuttle runs only  times  day,neg
to receiver poor,neg
there was nothing we didn like  it was fantastic,neg
staff doesn speak and understand english,neg
manager is never on site,neg
air con is not working,neg
no hot water,neg
the hotel is very dated  the wife is bad  it always goes out and every time it goes out or you leave the resort and come back you have to type in all of the login credentials  it is a pain to deal with  the rooms are kind of dark with few outlets for personal use,neg
the parking is very packed,neg
we originally reserved the premier bungalow but on check in were told that we were being upgrade to a pool room room not bungalow we had specifically booked a bungalow for the quiet and privacy and we were put in a single room with people on either side and above us we could hear every sound through the walls when we went back to reception and said we dont want the upgrade we just want the bungalow that we booked we were told that there were no bungalows available  and we had to spend the night in the room the next day we were moved to the sea breeze villa which was beautiful but could only stay there for three nights as it was booked after that so we had to move again if we were just put in the correct accommodation to begin with i would be giving a great review of this resort but we really felt like we weren treated very well and this has had a negative impact on my opinion of peace resort,neg
not much space in the rooms,neg
the dinner food is expensive and bad compared to what you can find nearby frozen spring rolls frozen french fires ridiculous amount of sauce in the caesar salad not worthy for the amount paid the service is good,neg
the breakfast included is good as well,neg
once you do the checkout they do not even borrow you an umbrella it doesn matter that there is no possibility of late check out is understand as it was fully booked but if you have to be at the hotel  more hours and its raining all day i think a  star hotel should have an umbrella to borrow,neg
there is no amenities in the bathroom there is shower caps that none use instead there is a chromic pot with shower get but you need to move it you will need it to use in the shower in the bath in the sink to clean your hands so it can be easily broken i really recommend the hotel to use plastic pots or ones than cannot be broken easily mostly if the customers will have to pay it if it is broken i understand customers pay things when things are broken for a bad use a bed a curtain a window i do not understand a chromic pot should be paid  as the chromic pot should not be in the bathroom,neg
i was in a bungalow in the beach when raining the bathroom was full of water as there was a water leak in the healing just next to the mirror it seemed it has been repaired several times,neg
a part from that the maintenance seemed to be really good nothing broken well painted good maintenance,neg
a design problem as the shower are open ceiling you can listen perfectly all your neighbours going to the bathroom not nice,neg
the mattress should be changed in few time,neg
the grm could be much better as the equipment was very dated and some broken overall though a lovely place to stay,neg
no safe in room locked available at reception with own lock but no combination locks allowed,neg
extremely expensive for the quality  really not a good breakfast compared to normal standards in thailand,neg
it could have been less expensive sea treatments in the hotel are particularly overpriced  more expensive than in europe,neg
external taxi service via hotel was appalling service was rude pretending not to have change did not receive change for service,neg
restaurant are a bit limited there are  but only  are on work if you want to stay in the resort lunch option is only  in breakfast menu are limited i stayed with my little kid most of food are western type i think they need to add more asia option,neg
some of the breakfast food was sitting in the hot sun for hours with a little rearranging of the restaurant area it could all be in the shade the restaurant grounds were not as well maintained as the other resorts we stayed at on oh same,neg
nothing not to like,neg
the administrative personnel front desk specially the ones that attended your concerns and they did not care once you paid for your stay and they should be a little bit more alert on their english speaking very defensive and arrogant,neg
room was a bit small so not sure how comfortable two people would be,neg
three kiss were in an almost too small room  no towels for the near beach  we received towels for the pool but not allowed to use them in the beachvery simple location not exciting twenty minutes drive from the airport,neg
our room was quite dark and small,neg
if anything a bit more bar service at the pool area,neg
location is not perfect quite a walk to the beach or centre but the hotel offers free transfer to beach c,neg
the pool in the honeymoon suite needs more attention,neg
change breakfast once in a while sometimes its always the same restaurant food is prices,neg
basic but all essentials,neg
the shower noble was broken so water shot out like a those from the pipe rather than going through the shower head,neg
my limited days in oh same,neg
surrounding areas dirty and smell much like all of the island,neg
nothing everything was perfect,neg
staffs are very focus on oversea travelers we are only that in the hotel,neg
the wife is not stable here  use phone data most of the time aircond make noisy voice sometimes but not frequently breakfast was simple and a littlebit overprice for me not recommended,neg
not much the beach in front of the hotel is a little muddy so we spent most of the time in the pool but the view is great perhaps a few more activities for guests such as kayaking paddle boat you class etc would make it the perfect place to stay,neg
the shower is poorly designed the water easily leads down to the doorway area and into the room huge gaps between the door and the floor allowing mosquitoes to easily fly into the room,neg
breakfast  big choice of low quality food dinner  ravioli with taste of burned pot  there were some noisy groups staying so we had music in a middle of the night if someone nearby is smoking we can feel in our room too,neg
the scuttle bus fees at the hotel was over prices it was double the price you should of been paying,neg
the taxi rank near the hotel had set prices and was defiantly what we should be paying way cheaper for example scuttle bus by hotel was bath to chewing while the the taxi rank stand was bath,neg
awesome location awesome pool friendly staff,neg
it was miles away from everywhere and you dont get wife in your room unless you pay,neg
pool villas were a bit too price compared to general level of the hotel,neg
the staff were rude bed was uncomfortable expensive for food and drinks lots of hidden charges lots of rules don’t like to help only allowed  towel a day is ridiculous,neg
pool area could be pushed  dealing varnished renewed cushion tops for sun beds and more umbrella,neg
room has loads of mostiqos shower had mould couch had stains room was very dark shower barely worked to was broken and remote had flat batteries,neg
breakfast offered was toast and jam,neg
no facilities the staff are not friendlypoor cleaning services many wizards and insects inside the room and bath room while eating lunch at the restaurant we have also seen wizards and frog so disgusting place,neg
too noisy near the main road,neg
difficult to swim at the beach outside the hotel the water was murky and the bottom muddy we went a bit further down the beach to the areas outside the bigger resorts which was a bit better but for sunbathing the area outside the hotel is nice,neg
we had a bad problem with ants in the room which were in our bed i went and complained she gave me an almost empty can of bug spray so we had to go buy our own we pulled the bed out and they were all around back of bed and seaboard seemed like they had been there a while maid service was very poor they just made the bed swept floor and put clean towels in they didn clean anything and we were there  nights bed was also very hard,neg
the place is a bit tired definitely could use a little refurbishing but then again it may run the price up wife was mostly stable although on the slow side although the room was clean it was not cosy as it would be if it got freshened up a little staff does not speak very good english no safe in the room only in the reception and you need to buy your own lock for it we didn use it air conditioning is very loud light sleepers wont be able to sleep with it running when we left they said we had broken a glass i dont know if they meant a drinking glass or what but i said we didn break anything and got the  bath deposit back,neg
grm facilities would have been good,neg
cockroaches in the bed in the middle of the night want fun the cubans smells bad the ac works but is sooooo loud it could have definitely been cleaner especially the bathroom that felt very not clean the staff doesn speak very good english and you can order a cab with them but it will be more expensive than regular cabs oh and so many others bags because of the many holes in the canada but,neg
the breakfast could be a bit better the staff was nice and there was plenty to choose from but its the small things a late for example was not included just normal coffee which didn taste that good we had to switch to tea,neg
i am not asia food fan so restraint menu looked too limited for me from european kind of food you can choose past some drilled meats couple of soups and salad that basically it but if you eat asia stuff you will be fine,neg
the food in the restaurant is not fantastic,neg
marketingsales event right after our arrival  bad timing,neg
should charge more,neg
the views from the window of my room also the room is quite small,neg
my only complaint was the wife but that was not of major concern for me,neg
i would recommend to use water shoes because a lot of persons were bitten by i think water hedgehog,neg
bring mosquitoes spray as well they gave us every evening mosquitoes spiral to fire up on the terrace because we told them there were to many mosquitoes free of charge,neg
really nice place good value for money i will be staying there again nice beach brilliant staff,neg
this hotel is quite tired and although once a luxury hotel it felt like the furniture could all do with a varnish and the walls a lick of paint it appears from the pictures that there is a garden there is not our garden view was the wall of the villa in front which had a sea view we had the sea villa and unless you have the most expensive villa with sea view you do not have a view at all from your villa and can hear the main road each of the three room types  are all in a long row so you have to walk quite far to get to the pool which is smaller than it appears and there are a lot of guests for a medium sized pool is situated right on quite a busy main road and the part of the beach this hotel fronts onto is actually a rocky outcry you need to walk quite far along the beach until you reach a nice swimming area there are no loungers on the beach at this hotel like you see in the pictures i actually think the photo on this site must have been photoshopped to show a different bit of beach were really disappointed with this hotel although our room was beautifully designed and decorated none of the details you expect from a hotel of this rating lived up to expectations the welcome drink was sweet orange square the complimentary shampoos a cheap brand all the little flowers that were on your pillows when you arrived were not cleared away when room was cleaned the next day once dead literally dead flowers lying around everywhere mentioned how disappointed we were with the lack of view and where our room was and were just quoted the price to upgrade our room to a sea villa nothing was done to recover the situation,neg
maybe a kettle in the room but its only a tender for the night so not an issue,neg
wanted more that food on menu crossing the road each time to get to main location a little tiresome but not too bad,neg
sad to say the bathroom smells bad like a toilet every time you take a shower but the rest of the time there was no smell free wife was very poor in our room had to stand next to the bathroom to get an ok signal,neg
the resort location was quite far from the main strip although we didn spend much time there anyway and taxes were quite expensive to get to most places,neg
the coffee at breakfast was very poor,neg
rooms could be more comfortable breakfast almost does not exist basically a solubile coffee bread and jam,neg
ac too loud,neg
airconditioner was way to loud,neg
if you wanted to be on the beach this is probably a min easy walk,neg
air con was to small for room and bed could have been bigger though the room was huge,neg
the shower is not so good the letter gets cold and hot all the time one of our room the shower room smells not good,neg
its location is set back from the beach but it is in beautiful grounds and our view from our penthouse was spectacular,neg
the bed was the forest i have ever sleep on,neg
noisy chinese people staying in the rooms either side of me no consideration for other guests,neg
the location is not centralnothing to visit around the hotel is very remote but if you like a holiday in the hotelgreat and it wasn’t difficult for us to take taxi everyday to the city just it takes time and money also food in the restaurant wasn’t bad but not great also,neg
это хорошая тройка of явно of четыре звезды,neg
the main building  sea pool and beach seemed run down and needed soon a clean up and renovation,neg
sometimes the order in the restaurant was misplaced chicken instead of shrimp or different icecream,neg
the place needs a lot of renovation and the photo are from a long time ago do not expect that condition when you arrive we had a lot of problems when we were there eg shower broken holes the size of my hand in our bed linen if this was the only place i were on the island for a week i would go crazy there is not enough space to relax and you are not close to town so you have to take a taxi,neg
i thought really long and hard to come up with any area where the hotel could improve only one thing comes to mind the location of the air conditioning unit in our room it was right beside the bed and it operated very loud it could disrupt sleep,neg
no elevator,neg
no windows in the room,neg
bed sheets were dirty we asked to change them the new ones were also dirty we asked again they came to check if this was correct and finally changed them with clean sheets lot of time wasted smell bathroomdoor of the balcony didn close they came to repair it on top of above mentioned we didn enjoy our stay in this hotel,neg
issues with bill on checking out we had pre paid and they charged  us for room and breakfast it took long time to sort this out as english was not good and then the isa machine wouldn’t work,neg
also  with so many staff doing nothing i would have liked to have seen the place tidied the gardens need attention weeds growing near beach access etc also bathroom needs more attention when cleaning  rim around bath tub hadn’t been cleaned in long time and same for jacuzzi jets,neg
air con is not man enough for size of room position is wrong and does not reach your pillow,neg
mice or squirrel in the ceiling cawing away all night,neg
the restaurant s food and breakfast tasted good but very limited choice and limited variety  only one kind of cheese and one kind of desert,neg
been here like  times over the years internet is now open to everyone no password internet was slow and went down often for a couple hours reception staff not friendly or helpful,neg
rooms were good but lacked space for clothing no drawers,neg
construction was going on across the street so was noisy and unsightly,neg
no complaints,neg
there was no breakfast there were no small face towels  towels were torn with holes beach lounge were old and destroyed,neg
no elevatorpoor breakfast,neg
rooms are too dimly lit,neg
drinks prices are high,neg
no singers or music at night,neg
not valuable to fisherman village,neg
not the cleanest and towels weren greatwifi sometimes bad but you can un and reply the outer in the hall which helps,neg
i liked nothing  such bad conditions i saw nowhere,neg
the bathroom were a bit run down and could do with some renovation the bathtubs had brown water stains and hence could be used only to stand in for shower and not as a bathtubs really,neg
there seems to be some senate smell from the drain in the bathroom as well,neg
other than that we loved everything else about blue wagon and will definitely be back hopefully get a room with a better bathroom facility,neg
simple nothing for us,neg
everything was perfect,neg
the only thing that would make this hotel any better would be wife in the rooms without charge,neg
die matratze war extreme hart,neg
hotel is good for the price,neg
rooms are a slightly run down but very liable,neg
didn try the food,neg
best location for newby in same,neg
first two days we had wind towards the beach it was very wavy and not suitable for swimming the beds are not comfortable the shower should be changed,neg
wanted payment up front as soon as we checked in even though payment was guaranteed via credit card also a  bath deposit on rooms no safe in rooms  you need to use a locked in reception so we didn bother,neg
there is nothing not to love about this place,neg
food taste,neg
breakfast was amazing but the restaurant by the pool didn’t serve a good food had there lunch was very expensive and not taste at all everything else was more than great,neg
the only place in thailand with no bide,neg
the daytimecasual dining was appealing,neg
they did not enforce the no reservation of deck lounge against the germans,neg
waters at restaurant preoccupied and less friendly than i would expect,neg
infrastructure is not as good as in the north of the island especially when it comes to transportation one can only take a taxes or rent a carmotorbike to get around the island songthaews pass by very rarely,neg
everything was perfect,neg
the breakfast and the coffee wast’t perfect,neg
toilet seat was too high,neg
rooms are way smaller than what they show you on photo,neg
staff at the dining area are quite dismissive the food was small portions and overpriced not a big enough menu or many healthy option,neg
a little prices compared to some similar newer properties,neg
couple of minor points there is not a small bin in the room and the lighting could be better on the stairs,neg
the amount of chlorine used in the pool was far too much,neg
breakfast was average,neg
mosquitoes in iron room tap water in glass turned up slightly brownish shower doesn drain well bedding served without blanket or thin quilt only a flat sheet for cover with the iron facing the bed,neg
having to pay for the taxes everywhere around  the per person per journey to chewing  fisherman’s village etc which over a course of  days and return taxes can add up to quite a lot would be nice to have a complimentary taxi service to areas that are close by,neg
no mosquito nets and the rooms with the fan do get quite hot but are good value for money,neg
the location isn’t really near any other bars and restaurant and have to get taxes to other places,neg
too many noisy kiss but probably because of the time of year jewish new year,neg
our room has a door that communicate with another room last day there was  or  people in the room near our and the noise was very big they spoke and spoke during the day but especially during the night with the door between the rooms we can here everything and it was in possible to sleep at midnight i call the receptionand finally they stopped,neg
it was hard to climb uphill especially under hot afternoon sun very poor restaurant not a good location for solo traveler without a motorbike it is far to walk to a good beach where you can swim to good restaurant to main walking street on chewing to good spas i would not recommend this property for solo travelers,neg
the beachside have some stones lying around in the water no sidewalk if you want to walk to the town,neg
expensive to get to to sang airport etc staff unwilling to call a general taxi and hotel prices were more expensive,neg
constant door in bathroom,neg
the hotel is getting old and is not well maintained,neg
broken air conditioned you have to report it now and then downstairs in the general switchboard in case you want to stop it or change temperature settings,neg
stained and crops on furniture and walls,neg
wizard too on the staircase didn move a centimetres in  days,neg
rust and water in the lights in the swimming pool shortest danger,neg
white slippers already yellow from previous guests use,neg
bad service from the other part of the staff  bad basic english comprehension,neg
inconsistency of the service  one morning you get  shrimp in your pad that the other  only three of the same size one morning they bring you a full bowl of granular and it has nuts and fruit in it the next morning you get  of it without any adding,neg
menu in the room was not up to date with prices in reality higher than indicated,neg
slow wife,neg
small pool and not many beds,neg
cold shower an electricity went off for a while,neg
the hotel was in a quiet area,neg
we got a bit unlucky some trash had washed up on the beach for a few days but walking along the beach more  especially towards the beach club you would find great places to swim of course this was a current and in no way the fault of the hotel,neg
first i anna say thanks a lot to may she’s the one on the reservation she’s so kind and the perfect person in that place and to all staff in regent resort,neg
breakfast just until  clock,neg
staff chatting loudly at  in the morning next to our door,neg
wife was not so good in our room,neg
quite noisy at night as close to local restaurant and bars music stopped at midnight air condition too noisy to leave on at night,neg
mosquito in the rooms,neg
i had asked the staff to book ferry tickets for our onward journey to oh to but on the day itself we discovered that they had forgotten to do so and we had to scramble around just so we could get the ferry we wanted that was really a major disappointment,neg
all pus and bars in the area close quite early perfect for a relaxing break on our travels,neg
unfortunately we cannot recommend the massage currently offered at sea garden we thought it would be a nice combination with the steam room but were disappointed with the whole experience,neg
at other places they wash your feet when you come inside give you something comfortable to change into play some tunes and have some decoration to create a relaxing atmosphere when they give massage they ask you if its too soft or too hard in our case it was way to soft which was the most disappointing use a ball for that massage and offer you a cup of tea and some fruit afterwards id love to see that at sea garden,neg
the staff at the reception counter needs to improve on their english communication be more friendly and unapproachable most of the staff do not give any greetings as like other hotels we have stayed in the beach is a  minute walk across road and we have to pass through a resort to reach to the beach the hotel is  minutes drive to chewing centre a petered taxi will charged the while a output van will charge the per person most tuktuk van dont even know where the location of this property,neg
airport is too close very  noisy,neg
run down dirty room eg hair of former renter on the floor kitchen and restaurant dirty even for that standards,neg
the staff went away after  pm and there was no one to attend us during late hours at night,neg
no poolsupper was not as good as in the many superb restaurant nearby,neg
all the facilitiesbreakfast includedare  stars at the most to our standards the problems lies in the priceproduct relation far too expensive  i spent half in other similar hotels in thailandbe careful because they charge the credit card in advance despite bookingthey made up giving us for free the transportation back to the airport under our “suggestion “,neg
cost of private taxi to town,neg
we paid for breakfast but at the hotel we were told that no breakfast will be served due to closing of the restaurantwifi connection was coexisting didn work anywhere on the hotel areaalso some major construction work was going on  peters from the room luckily we didn sleep long 😀,neg
bathroom could be betteronline the room stated it had a bath but it did notalso states the room has a tumble dwyer but it does not more european breakfast option and a little more variety for breakfast needed,neg
noisy very poor shower not inviting beach no covers,neg
no breakfast included this was discussed with owner saline who said they were in the process of,neg
providing breakfast soon,neg
we were very disappointed with this hotel the pictures did not match the pictures on bookingcom the rooms were old tired and needed upbraiding the bathroom was old and somewhat not inviting there was ants in the room we had cockroaches in the bathroom and spider in the bed in the first room we had the hotel was not a short distance away from the main street and the road to go was quite nasty and dirty we had read that transportation to the city was free but we had to pay  bath to be driven into chewing street the day we were going to check out the breakfast lady was angry with us and we were there at  she meant the breakfast did not start before  pm oven do the reception said the breakfast was from  she was very angry and little service minded we vol  not step here again and would rather choose a hotel in chewing street,neg
friendly staffs nice beach perfect for family,neg
the balcony like the window,neg
the only thing people might not like is the airplane flying over head they make an incredible noise and start from am,neg
can’t complain about anything when everything was looked after to perfection,neg
first of all there was a bad swewage smelling coming from the bathroom that the staff tried to hide by using scented candles we also didn like the pool which was small and only  cm deep the restaurant was quite price so we had to walk on a busy road about  minutes to get to some more unfordable places there were no lights only dim lightning in the bathroom so it was impossible to shave in the mirror,neg
limit choice of breakfast,neg
dirty bedclothes hotel was described as family friendly this was not the case during the night prostitutes were arguing loudly with customers on the corridor of the hotel they her screaming and doors were slammed loudly sounding like explosions in the middle of the night,neg
the room of my daughters had bedclothes with stained this was reported and  they were offered a new room in that room they encountered the same issue again it was reported and they were offered another room same problem again finally we gave up  as proof of the dirty sheets i have attached  pick,neg
again i would not recommend this hotel to anybody pick on the site are also misleading there are pick with nice seats on the beach however the hotel is not located at the beach,neg
also the rooms were super noisy,neg
will never stay there again and will definitely not recommend this hotel to anybody to me it looks like a scar,neg
part of the trip on my own  mainly couples,neg
perhaps the room towels could be replaced they are getting old  thin our bed linen was not changed during our  day stay  breakfast was superb however perhaps a small price drop would be beneficial,neg
bungalows are connected by a door that doesn’t give enough privacy can hear everything that happens in the neighbours room,neg
not many things to do in close area,neg
they should pay more attention on email when i booked i request airport scuttle and more information but they never answer it,neg
quite far for families with kiss for walking distance to central festival mall centre of chewing  others are fine,neg
nothing in particular  shame we weren there longer,neg
far from walking street,neg
once dmitri left it was very chronic and we no longer got breakfast served in our room,neg
a bit far from the beach but you can rent motorbikes at the hotel and you have free scuttle,neg
bit difficult to find,neg
very pleased with all,neg
there is no proper food and you need to walk to get anything you want we were okay with that but it can be annoying,neg
there was not really a proper beach that we found in other areas of the island,neg
the pipe water  there were a few times water want available and the hotel staff said this affected the whole island though we couldn verify for sure it was irritating to say the least especially when we needed to bath or use the bathroom,neg
the restaurant,neg
the bed was rock hard,neg
nothing really unlikable nighttime a little quiet,neg
dinner was expensive and didn taste good,neg
allies perfect super large toller service,neg
maybe a few more translate by the beachpool area would be good,neg
staff look extremely demotivated,neg
the whole hotel need a renovation,neg
restaurant prices are outrageous same compared to europe,neg
breakfast needs more creativity,neg
nights can be noisy due to surrounding wildlife,neg
an extra  added for payment by card  this seems to happen just about everywhere in thailand this place would have been really special when first built i guess but now it could do with a little more in the way of tic and maintenance,neg
not much not to like even playing with the small that kiss in the pool in an english teacher was enjoyable and fun great staff,neg
the restaurant was quite expensive however the hotel great value for money,neg
the apartment is certainly rather worn around the edges and could do with a master a dishcloth and teatowel and some salt and pepper the biggest worry i think is health and safety  there is only one set of stairs no fire escape and a restaurant downstairs,neg
everything was perfect,neg
bed was not comfortable very hard,neg
except for that the report is located in lips not and is quite far from lamp and chewing the resort just feels like paradise away from all the rustle its worth it,neg
it sunk of mould rip off give just paid a rd of the price to stay up the road and its  times better,neg
it might be i am that the breakfast zone a bit hot no air circulation much and it has only ceiling fan to cool the the hemp donne process for checking that the staff asked forcredit card of my booking which i didn bring it with me the reservation i made via bookingcom it did not state anywhere that the hotel required credit card for check in anyway the staff made it done by preparing me another form to fill in for me to authorize the hotel to use the credit card for room charging actually i think this is good procedure for checking in to ensure that the card use by holder not from someone else but this  required policy should inform guest in advance after the reservation has been confirmed even though the guest did not reserve the room via hotel,neg
enclosed courtyard outside roomfelt like in jail   very slippery times around pool area not good selection of non alcohol cocktailsbeach towels could have better systeminstead of only  per day,neg
difficult to adjust the room aircond temperature not sure it was malfunction,neg
like other travellers have said the rooms are very dated the sea in my room was unable and was covered in rust with duct tape holding it together in places there were no working phone connecting the rooms with reception and the wife was temperamental at best the rooms have no natural sunlight and were very dark and gloomy  my friends room had terrible plunging issues and at one point there was dirty water springing from a burst pipe which flooded the bathroom floor the staff said someone would look into it the following day and that there were no free rooms to move her to in the meantime only after she said she would take a refund and book another hotel did another room in the hotel miraculous seem to materials this hotel is falling apart and the poor staff are clearly used to having to deal with guests complaining about the state of the place it must be very difficult for the staff having to deal with constant complaints for things that they really have no control over,neg
the beach have the alae the swimming pool have a bit leaving my room have the smell from the toilet,neg
the food want fantastic,neg
breakfast is not worth such an hotel standard,neg
no enough choice no real fruit juice batteries not fresh very disappointed by it,neg
the aircond turned off many times in the middle of night,neg
as far as i remember genius peaks include welcoming drinks however i did not get one,neg
does that have anything to do with having separate and backtoback reservations,neg
you can’t get much sleep because people are up right through the night drinking it’s a great hotel if you want to party if you ant to chill i definitely would stay somewhere else,neg
garage in beach and the bad in breakfast not freschthe van timetable and availability to short take  in consideration the distance to city centertáxi services with  higher prices comparing with our quotation,neg
the breakfast and the coffee wast’t perfect,neg
bar prices were expensive,neg
it was a longer walk from the main clubs than expected maybe about mind felt fine walking there but decided to get a taxi back every time as it felt safer,neg
the that night needs to be better organised so people understand when to get food in between shows also the food needs to be replenished more often,neg
would have loved the pool to have extended closing hours from pm to pm  i understand why it closes at pm  we rushed to the hotel in time to use it one night but by the time we got in it was  and we could not use it which was a shame,neg
no breakfast since restaurant was under renovation,neg
the rooms are a little dated and out to didn work,neg
had a few mosquitoes in the room but the hotel offered a plug in repellent with refills and we brought some spray from the eleven just down the road and that fixed them 😊,neg
we loved everything,neg
not so many games we played only mind golf and badminton something was under construction maybe that why,neg
was informed that the use of the karay was at a cost  before booking this accommodation we were under the impression that to use the kayaks it was free,neg
so where to start this is supposed to be a resort but for the experience we had might as well have stayed in an hostel it would be cheaper and the conditions would be the saviour bed was composed by two mistresses which is really cool for your back right nobody came to clean our room and change the towels during the all  nights we stayed there although they said we had free bottle water per night because nobody came to clean the room no water was delivered either and due to the proximity with the international airport the noise of the plains was very distinct and loud in the room they literally fly close to the roofed finally i really didn like being obliged to leave my passport at the reception in form of key deposit they wont let you leave a copy of it instead and its either that or leave  bath in cash  with is absurd like  europe for a key deposit most places ask for  bath and the keys are way more technot good pricequality ratio for sure location isn also good,neg
nothing i can think of,neg
too many children taking over the swimming pools by diving in over people taking running jumps into water and causing potential accidents as not being warned by pool staff,neg
hotel security shooting a catapult at the beach dogs causing them to bleed not acceptable,neg
the wife can be accessed from the dormitory rooms ac was not working properly but then on complaint it was repaired the next day also wife was not working properly,neg

there is a mouse in there,neg
the path you need to take to reach to the town and the see,neg
beach and sea are awful see through distance in water is only cm,neg
smoking is allowed in communal areas eg by the pool given the pool chairs are close together its unfortunate also a few other rude guests being far too noisy facetiming in the pool etc,neg
outdated bathroom hard mattress and pillows,neg

lot of steps climbing all over the resort,neg
no ac at ocean kiss restaurant and it was too hot during breakfast hours so i could not enjoy my breakfast as mosquitoes were all over,neg
good view and beautiful villa design,neg
restaurant had great food but maybe a little price rooms were clean but old and probably due for a renovation,neg
it is far from center,neg
receptions asked us to write a good feedback in exchange for  free drinks,neg
nothing major the music at times was fighting with the next door barrestaurant  just adjust the volume together with them or play the same music,neg
you would think with  reviews over the last  months complaining that the breakfast was uncovered and flies were all over it that they would have fixed that issue hope flies still everywhere all over every dish breakfast was a huge let down,neg
check in was terrible staff was rude dont advertise property as pay later if it isn even though we booked to pay at the property we were told  days before our stay to pay online otherwise our booking would be canceled then upon arrival we had our credit card payment refused and then played in cash strange way of conducting business,neg
some of the staff were extremely rude whilst some were very nice,neg
if i was to stay in chewing again i would choose somewhere else there is a lot of nice places for a better price,neg
수압이 of of 점 시설보수가 미흡조식이 비용대비 부실함아오낭 비치가 매인비치라서 그런지 주변에 갈만한 of of 않음아오낭비치 갈려면 of of 발생해서 of 휴양만 하는게 of,neg
cheaper transport from the hotel would be good a better snack menu for room service,neg
front desk closes at pm my room did not have working air conditioning he first night dark property with stray dogs running all over,neg
shower gets entire bathroom wet room has unpleasant smell pretty noisy coming mostly from announcements on the main road no netscreen in window so can open window without bags swarming in,neg
holiday was ruined by monsoonal rain and flooding the resort hoped with it mostly but the beach was thrashed we were here for  days and couldn swim in the ocean obviously the weather is out of the resorts control however the facility was not set up for this kind of weather there were very few places to go other than in our rooms,neg
i booked  room but came with  pp needing  rooms but was charged more then on the bookingcom,neg
also wanted b per room key that is insane,neg
also one staff member kept on hitting on my sum,neg
some kiss activities are a little prices,neg
better stairs arrangement but the staff extremely help with our heavy luggage didn like smokers from other tourist unavoidable,neg
rooms are tired looking with poor lighting in the room  especially the  bathroom  we was in a superior room which i expected better the beach bar needs a overhauled too,neg
room had step from bed platform to main floor could become dangerous in dark nearly twisted ankle,neg
nothing except i wanted to have my room earlier around  pm but could not however it is the season  totally understandable of the situation,neg
no bacon at breakfast but for the price its ok,neg
our extra guest bed mattress was very hard compared to the main bed mattress,neg
the beach has a lot of stones it is not available for swimming one of the lady from restaurant who is very impatient also her smile is really face to make me turned my feeling of the hospitality of this resort,neg
given a better room than expectedvery close to pool  beachpool is open nonstopunbelievably clean seagreat unfordable restaurant all daybeach facilities inch massage free of chargeclose to the main road to get tuktuks,neg
please ensure when booking you are not booking the tea hotel which the budget part of the hotel joining the property,neg
nothing to not like,neg
toilet did not flush properly,neg
the sea view pool villa closest to reception needs a screen of some sort so people walking in the entrance can’t see you getting in and out of the pool,neg
breakfast was right but lunch and dinner choice could be better more sea fresh products expected,neg
there were a few problems in our room and they tried to fix them but it want fixed,neg
air con took a long time to cool the room but was still very good,neg
wizards everywhere,neg
a bit noisy place  in the middle of night life there was no hook in the ceiling so we could not use all the best stuff we found room,neg
staff at the reception is not able to help you other than check snout due to poor english skill,neg
for a  star hotel that was quite more expensive than the rest of  stars in the area it was not as good as we expectedshould be,neg
breakfast was quite bad bread and parties were like plastic and replenishment was very slow and you would have to insist on the staff so that they replenished it,neg
the first bungalow we got was on the end of the yard next to the road so it was quite noisy with the cars and motor on top of that the first day at am there was a lot of noise of people screaming and laughing from outside we had to change the room then one day that was raining we had a leak in the roof and water was pouring in although they fixed it in  minutes luckily we were in the room,neg
we chose this hotel for all the services but also because it had a grm when we arrived the treadmill was broken a nd they kept on telling us that it would be fixed but they just ignored us until we spoke to the manager,neg
nothing it was a great experience,neg
to many stairs but they pick ou up in golf cart went you phone for one,neg
a little bit noisy for couples as a lot of families and kiss were visiting there is only  treadmill at the grm sometimes kiss would come and play with grm facilities and i wish there was hotel staff supervising,neg
nothing much but i wish it was pet friendly,neg
limit choice of breakfast,neg
bathroom was dirty there was a kettle in the room but no coffeetea,neg
bad signal very difficult to see the entrance to the resort,neg
similar breakfast each day not a huge variety  if you dont have transport it is located away from the beach shops and most of the action in chewing,neg
the beach and poolside deckchairs need replacing they are quite uncomfortable it would be handy to have a chair in the rooms  we stayed in room,neg
staff could be more friendly and helpful,neg
unfriendly staff not clean property problems with looters,neg
i paid for a villa with private swimming pool which was very nice,neg
the room was hot the air con is weak and that the situations in all their villas,neg
to pay so much money and not sleep well is a waste of money and vacation time,neg
pillows are cheap no down pillows,neg
food in the hotel is way overpriced especially in the restaurant and quality is very low,neg
do yourself a favor and go eat outside amazing fresh food and much cheaper,neg
more authentic that food for breakfast more variety,neg
rooms very old needs a lot of improvement,neg
room didn looked like on the pictures stuff is only friendly in case you dont have any questions the hotel manager was the friendliest person we ever met we had questions about a wrong booking and she just wanted us to pay she also count talk to us in a professional way lazy of talking to us selfish tourist we didn felt welcome in any way people who dont want to pay taxidrivers just to take our money shouldn work in a social job we highly advise against this accommodation in the end we paid more just to make sure the taxi driver will get his money  additional breakfast is not worth the moneysmall rooms couldn close the door properly only  lights workedwhen you had a shower the whole bathroom was under water up to your ankles no properly blanket no fresh towels,neg
dont let this comments to throw you out of this place but you should be aware of it the actual hotel needs a renovation it shows its bit tired for what it charges like every place at some point it needs renovation the hotel provides  restaurant and another one that opens only x a week the hotel was fully booked when i stayed and i think they could have had a third option in the end if you are there for more than  nights like us its good to have another option the food at the pool restaurant needs improve another suggestion is to create more activities  you only available twice a week  and please change those sunbrellas for a proper up protection and not a mash as its at the moment the sun in thailand burns unfortunately not everyone can handle the sun overall its a great place in pick because its not cheap and therefore id expect more for what give paid,neg
i couldn fault the place everything was pretty much perfect the only thing i could say is that its not as close to fisherman village as i would have liked but its only a short taxi trip  bath away,neg
the chef cook seems to lack enthusiasm about his job i dont feel his passion for teaching at the cooking class,neg
shower was a bit old and dirty,neg
no air conditioning so many insects and wizards in the room flow of water very less in mushroom,neg
there was construction on the beach that was noisy although it was beyond their control,neg
nice big room very clean room for the decent price,neg
beach thin peace of sand,neg
there was nothing we didn’t like perfect stay great value for money,neg
the hotel needs to be updated bathroom needs a refurbished as rooms look tired,neg
a bit far from the center but it is also an advantage,neg
the room was a little more rustic than was portray in the pick  so i was a bit uncertain that we had made the correct choice however it was spotless clean and became an afterthought,neg
the sea and beach close to the hotel were not the best of the island,neg
there is no airport scuttle bus they simply call you a taxi they said it will be  bath which is way too expensive for a  minute drive once i got to the airport the driver accepted  bath so the hotel were clearly lipping me off the taxi fare which should have been no more than  bath it was a really hot day and i had lots of luggage so i didn want to walk the streets in the heat to find my own shared taxi but i didn expect to be gripped off by the hotel after i spent  nights there not nice,neg
when i booked online i paid for a deluge room when they showed me to my room on arrival they gave me a superior room once i connected with wife i accessed my booking and went to reception to check if they had me in the right room they ended up moving me but didn seem to check any details they just took my word for it which makes me think they may try to cheat guests out of what they paid for frequently so do check all details when you check in so you get what you paid for,neg
drinks at the bar dont include tax and service charge a little speak as most other bars of nearby hotels charge exactly the price on the drinks menu tax  service charge included a cheeks extra charge here and there service on the beach was poor i had to wait a while and ended up getting my own drinks,neg
the phone in my room was down i couldn call out as they said they were having technical issues on that day next day exactly the same turns out you can call out from reception either i think the phone in the rooms are just for show,neg
food location and swimming pool,neg
family rooms could have been a little more private and the mistresses were too soft  this could be a personal choice of course,neg
misleading pictures,neg
no  night activities at beach area,neg
dirty public areas,neg
they used to have lovely gardens and now they are looking a little shabby,neg
it would have been nice if there were toilet in the ground floor there is no assistance in bringing the luggage  there are two stairs to get inside the villa but some more to go up to the bed room the location is far from the center  you need to have a motorbike if planning to book the hotel,neg
we didn known the pool was located at another part of the hotel there is a free scuttle or you can walk  minutes we weren interested in either option just not convenient also the beach at the hotel is murky and too shallow for swimming you need to walk about  minutes down the beach to swim,neg
room and facilities,neg
the room smelt of must and when you went to bed it felt like the sheets were wet every night,neg
shower was lukewarm at best cold mostly and the same for the bath the water was too cold to have a bath which was a pity,neg
we arranged a scuttle bus from airport but we waited  minutes before the driver got there and as we were paying for this scuttle it was a little annoying,neg
it has potential to be a lovely resort but the gardens and pool area need a good overhauled as there was debris and leaves rubbish cardboard from new years eve celebrations lying around down by the loungers which were wooden with no fashioning my back was breaking after lying on it,neg
the bed was very hard and uncomfortablecould hear the neighbours next door talking and drinking all night outside the room,neg
nothing for anybody with difficulty walking it is worth noting that rooms are over  floors with no lift,neg
they sold out of do perignon,neg
hotels sea was just okay,neg
poor internet nightclub across the road a little loud,neg
the hotel only offered expensive taxes but it seems to be a feature on oh same,neg
the roomsbalconies could and should be cleaner and better maintained little things like light bulb had blown and not been replaced,neg
grm could be improved,neg
swimming pool beds are close to each other round the pool lacking privacy,neg
many things were broken  tap shower head etc sharp knife not much of a comfort for the value if you want to cook for yourself also they rented us super small and old uncomfortable bike we didn go to beachfront as it were cross the road,neg
there are a lot of steps that was fine with us we are fairly fine but if you have mobility issues they would be a problem,neg
prices within the hotel were extortionate sundry is charged at  bahtkg which is very excessive even on an island and it takes  days to have it washed food is also expensive the beach at the front of the hotel is also dirty and should be cleaned you need to walk further some  metre to reach a cleaner beach other hotels had better and cleaner sand at their beach location bathroom flooded every time and it floods towards the toilet,neg
buildings are a bit tired,neg
the airplane flying over head,neg
the villas are very nice but if i stayed longer i wouldn have liked the fact that they have no view at all,neg
absolutely no air in the room,neg
impossible to sleep in when its hot,neg
the resort are divided in different buildings the building were the cheapest room are is on the main street of lamp beach i am speculating but if you are in a room facing this street  maybe it can be noisy in the evening night as the nighttime in lamp last until the early morning hours the wife in our room was not worth mentioning  it was almost non existing,neg
location chewing is a big place the hotel is on an incredibly steep hill and you need to taxi to and from the resort for minimum  bath each the free scuttle was much appreciated but needs to run more frequently and run pick up,neg
they were buildingrenovating a third pool at the time as we paid a reasonable price for the hotel i want gathered by this in sure it will be amazing when finished,neg
smokers are everywhere around the swimming pool it needs to be restricted,neg
the pillows are flat and to soft but the bed is comfortable if you are tall mind your head everything is that size only,neg
the room stand especially the bathroom,neg
the ac didn work in the first room,neg
we had to make repeated complaints to get the room changed the staff didn care much about the complaints we finally got the room changed to a much smaller one this is after paying a higher price for the bigger room,neg
the food was atrocious haven tasted such bad food in thailand before,neg
the first room they gave was on the ground floor  had a smell of mould so they provide a second on the st floor the rooms are not big enough for the standards of thailand i think it is expensive for what it provides  i would stay there again only for one night and only if my flight is at  in the morning the breakfast had big variety of food but the quality was mediocre,neg
didn like the bathroom it was an all in  one toilet and  shower,neg
i found someone else underwear in the room when i first arrived,neg
but other than that no issues,neg
very much secluded you are pretty much forced to use their restaurant etc unless you hire a carmotor bike,neg
rooms are not like photo shown,neg
not value for money,neg
internet was not good,neg
not enough sun loungers by the pool and none on the beach,neg
expensive cab rides from and to the hotel,neg
ac was very loud and blowing straight in to the beds beds were quite hard also there are no locks in any of the buildings doors,neg
we expected a budget hotel for the price paid but the room had small insects in which were everywhere  this led to a poor nights sleep before flight home,neg
wife connection was also very poor although improved slightly when rest by manager,neg
no wife in the rooms,neg
pretty far away from chewing,neg
bags coming often to the room although i understand the hotel is in the nature more efforts should be made during the cleaning to ensure that cockroaches are not in the cabinet,neg
the hotel advertised for salaries that include elephant wrecking dragging tigers so you can take series it is all about making money and little concern around the ethical concerns of animal welfare,neg
customer service was adequate nothing extraordinary,neg
shower was difficult to regulate  from getting burned with hot or frozen with cold water did not stay set to hemp selected lifts here you have a lot of steps from lobby to your room  to restaurant  beach,neg
the rooms were not cleaned properly the bathroom did not smell good it was more or less the same at a hotel in bangkok,neg
the a la carte breakfast did not provide many healthy vegetarian option,neg
they charged us for something that we did not take from the mind bar,neg
also it could get pretty noisy at times because the doors are not isolated at all,neg
the room was too dark no lights and far away from the pool the beach and the restaurant and we needed to climb two floors without elevator it looks like it wasn’t part of the hotel,neg
lots of sand but be prepared its a beach,neg
as usual in thailand dangers etc at the wall would be appreciated,neg
bed and pillows were tough for me  the hotel had no chairs on the beach you had to rent or stay at the pool  some rooms overlook noisy night life and we had to change to a quieter room the staff were very helpful about that,neg
our room was ok it was not especially nice or comfortable our pillows were uncomfortable the building of our room was impressive and not connected to the pool and restaurant complex you have to cross an alley although its not far the location is not great its a    minute drive from the chewing city center or you can walk on the beach although at high tides the rest of the chewing beach is not easily accessible you have to wade through the water making the beach small,neg
wife is terrible also the to was really small and the signal was bad,neg
the breakfast could have had more variety and had some wealthier option,neg
the toilet was old and not clean enough,neg
too much to list in  sentences the place is run down the location is not suitable for people looking for a beachside resort it is on the coast but the beach is small and the water gets cm deep at most  at high tide great for kiss i guess you will hear every plane take off from the airport thankful there are only about forty per day it is at the top of the hill on the way into town we re fit and keen walker but otherwise you are calling to and from town every night not expensive but its a cost,neg
no hot water unless you take a more expensive room which we didn know the male receptions is brilliant sorry can remember the name but the female just wanted to sell regardless if it matches our needs,neg
more local restaurant within walking distance would be nice,neg
rooms are pretty small at least mine was with only just enough room for me to put my backpack in a corner of the room to not be in the way  bed took up most of the room but hey  i didn come here to live in the room lucky because i had to put up with random gurgling water noise from sinktoilet,neg
expensive food and drink,neg
service from staff and room comfort,neg
basic but all essentials,neg
nothing all was wonderful,neg
the girl from the reception seemed a bit rude during checking wife was the worse give ever had poor signal and frequent disconnections,neg
very little to mention but one grip was allowing smoking around the pool and eating areas,neg
the airport is very close and all the plains pass over the hotel when landing or taking off so it is very noisy but from h to h they are not flying,neg
the breakfast want included and the breakfast in its restaurant was baths and baths at the beach side quite expensive,neg
they offer taxi to the airport but its not taximeter its hotel car and quite expensive too baths,neg
the area is far from everything so you need to move by motorbike taxi midian walking there is not nice neither because of the sidewalk are full of obstacles,neg
the pool was horrible full of infection very bad address,neg
the aircondition in the room made incredible noise noise from the street impossible to sleep polite staff trying to sell other things to me the food was just nasty dirty,neg
not a single thing everything was perfect here just be prepare that it is not a cheap place and if you look for one go somewhere else,neg
workman making a noise throughout the daytime,neg
place is totally old located in the small street and hardly to park your car,neg
the owner was nice at first but service after sell  after she got money from mess really disappointed when we asked for cleaning service she should have told us that it isn available at the second day of our stay she just ignored my request kept us wait for her for a while no equipment for cleaning not at all   the stove doesn work properly all tubs in every single room are dirty  in not recommend you to stay here waste the money,neg
current house activities are not interestingresort of such scale should have house activity centre  more fun indoor and outdoor activities for guests in  boardgames beach games conduct and into snorkelling kayaking other water related classes for guests  could also have more activities for kiss water playground movie screening etc,neg
there want anything i didn like,neg
no hot water at early morning,neg
beach is a bit rocky and could be a little cleaner,neg
i didn like the cleanliness the pool should have been cleaned better and some elements of the room needed upbraiding sofa was very dirty and the bathroomkitchenette are dated,neg
balcony is quite small the iron unit took up a lot of space on the balcony and was quite loud so made it difficult to enjoy the balcony,neg
the satellite to want very good  i was unable to watch anything in good quality images barely reached standard definition quality,neg
however it was a comfortable hotel and for the money  if on budget i would stay again,neg
the sheets was always the same no shampoo the inside design was terrible and the kitchenroom totally useless the bathroom not so comfortable especially for the shower without protection any shower means the bathroom totally wet i would raccomend to remove the useless swimming pool taking back so many money to allow them to increase more service if they were better the structure is not so bad the garden is quite good and the stuff too,neg
the location between two permit was at the beachbut it want useful also the street was very busy and loud,neg
dated interior shower no water pressure just a trickle hot upstairs,neg
the breakfast could have been a bit better but it was ok,neg
only thing is the pool doesn have a bar or it does but with no working in it,neg
nothing really,neg
the bathroom was not in good condition the water did not drain  flowed so every shower  the floor towel get wet  few days we did not have hot water  the staff promised to check but finely remain with same condition be carefully for your fingers with the bath sliding doors as it catch my fingers twice,neg
die restaurantqualität be  sterner it ausnahme fruhstuck enttäuschend,neg
die schaumstoffkopfkissen machine massage unerkläßlich,neg
to channel angelo missing,neg
nothing everything was great,neg
bathroom a bit small,neg
quality of bed was not the best,neg
the only negative point was on our last day we decided to visit the resort sea for a final massage both massage were quite poor which for thailand in general is rare  especially in a luxurious  star resort the sea subsequently provided a partial refund which was appreciated however it did leave us with slightly negative feelings to what was a perfect vacation,neg
the rooms are a bit small to fit a backpack in,neg
not very close to the beach,neg
the breakfast are awkward because they ask if we want duck or pork but then is surprisingly good and they also have some continental breakfast like bread and cereals,neg
the staff  are nice when u anna check in but when u want to check out they dont care anymore didn carry out bags on the way out i asked them to print something they refused,neg
the price of the hotel taxi company to chewing for example which is a  min drive is  bath  that said oh samuel taxi prices are western prices so going back to the hotel will cost you another  bath  totalling at about  per one trip to chewing side thought ill rent a car or a sooner but it is not an easy drive in the dark on rainy season after a bottle of wine,neg
the fact they didn’t give me the option to extend the staying in few hours although the hotel was with free rooms,neg
i choose this resort also for the pool but it was dirty and close for all the day the service for the airport is really too expensiveask outside to the taxi driver they make less,neg
after i made my coffee in the room the kettle exploded without being plunged anymore in lucky i didn got hurtwater want draining in the shower,neg
everything was great,neg
the restaurant was very expensive the room was large and air conditioned but waking up one morning to cockroaches was not the best experience the beach is beautiful and the swimming pool lovely but the amount of children that are not watched ruined the experience there were many children too so it was very noisy at times,neg
mould bathroom and one of our bathroom had the most vile smell coming from it unable broken toilet seat,neg
there is no flush in the toilet,neg
the attention of the waters for the food service and the food quality could have been better,neg
small room and noisy neighbors,neg
nothing  honestly,neg
rooms needs some maintenance,neg
there were a few wizards that got into our room not sure how but it want our fault when we arrived at am the security guy was not notified that we were arriving so it took us around one hour to get into our room the staff did react very well to this though and they were very helpful,neg
we asked for a lift to the airport and the hotel is three times more expensive than the usual price,neg
there was no water supply for over  hours due to a malfunction  the compensation we received was ridiculous,neg
no breakfast service,neg
breakfast could be improved,neg

room could be updatedfreshened new paint shower should drain  the lighting in the bathroom was horrible,neg
staff was not cooperative enough,neg
all fine 👍,neg
the room was a bit small and not so come bed no fridge,neg
we went to the buffets at  and there was nothing to eat,neg
the place needs a lot of renovation and the photo are from a long time ago do not expect that condition when you arrive we had a lot of problems when we were there eg shower broken holes the size of my hand in our bed linen if this was the only place i were on the island for a week i would go crazy there is not enough space to relax and you are not close to town so you have to take a taxi,neg
i wouldn complain about anything its up a steep hill so dont be an idiot hire a sooner through the owners and travel up the hill in comfort honestly you can enjoy oh same without a sooner anyway,neg
hut can get a bit warm as only fan and the wife doesn reach them unless right next to restaurant these are little things as we loved our stay and would recommend to all,neg
the facilities needs a bit of refurbishment,neg
the sea was pretty basic in the sense that they were only small cabins for the anna and the steam plus access was not included it was charitable neither the jacuzzi that is only in the couple treatment room massage were good and staff really nice,neg
the bathroom need some attention little upbraiding would be in order also some new towels would be a good investment,neg
breakfast need to be improved,neg
can’t think of anything everything was fine,neg
booking shows the hotel is nonsmoking while there are astray in rooms as well as designate smoking area right by the restaurantthe pool,neg
breakfasts almost dont change and are quite heavy too many meals with meat,neg
rooms have balconies not terrace without sunbeam can sabbath there but hey u can smoke,neg
not enough room for all the quests by the pool and da beach beach is narrow and does not get cleaned that well,neg
several power cutshowever we have since found this is all over the island at the moment due to a problem with the underwater cable in the ocean the only thing that could be improved is the cleanliness of the roof top pool seemed very dirty when we got in,neg
hard access at evening because of the tax from the hotel to the  beach specially with baby strolled  the basic rooms far away from the pool and the beach,neg
room is booked as villa but not at all just a small room that can be entered from garden,neg
pool was nice but could be in a better but prank is starting to build a new one in may so everything should be fine soon,neg
weak wife,neg
bed is a bit hard,neg
bedding was in shreds sheets stained,neg
the bathroom was a little small,neg
its anything that i can say,neg
stayed here  years ago when just being built sad to see how run down it has become old pool dealing loosebroken floor boards broken bathroom fixture if management reads this shame on you spend the money fix this urgently before if falls apart upgrade to  room private villa overall for  people,neg
the bungalows closest to the road are not so quiet on day time the beach chairs and area was also for tourist groups reserved and not so many choice for own guests  would have been good to know this into beforehand christmas music for couple of days in a row in the restaurant was too much,neg
mistresses on sunbeam umbrella at the swimming pool need dating there dirty and torn,neg
breakfast,neg

awfulsuperior rooms were so dark you needed light on all the time very poor value for money only information in rooms was what you would pay for lost broken items on last day we were leaving at am so  persons not having breakfast i had also paid  bath per day for  year old to have breakfast would only provide transport to airport for  bath walked down street and was half the pricepool gave all of the children skin irritation,neg
beach and ocean lots of rocks that made it difficultunsafe  to swim in the ocean you could not relax the beach but on the property overlooking the beach no chairs etc on the small beach,neg
absolutely nothing,neg
all was good really,neg
food was below standard and expensive breakfast was basic at best i broke a glass in the bathroom and they charged me  europe which i think is petty they also charged too much to arrange transport for hours and taxes,neg
shower need attention the temperature in different rooms kept varying,neg
fauces at breakfast are in a place where there is no space to put your plate down apparently other guests had complained of the same thing when we mentioned it but the resort manager or owner is not interested to fix it,neg
some pool chair cushions are quite worn for a  star hotel wooden dealing is starting to look feathered and could use a coat of varnish,neg
when we checked in only  girl on the desk and it took us about  minutes to check in,neg
staff in the eveningnight didn have good english so it was hard to ask any questions,neg
quite noisy at night as close to local restaurant and bars music stopped at midnight air condition too noisy to leave on at night,neg
a little prices compared to some similar newer properties,neg
the staff was next level unfriendly and unhelpfull and barely spoke any english the owner was great always smiled and was very helpful and clear such a shame that such a good host has such bad employees,neg
wife not the best if not in the reception,neg
le restaurant,neg
not the best position of ac little noisy which is predictable when you book a hotel at this location,neg
we liked everything,neg
chinese group they were loud early and late at night,neg
the location is a little far,neg
family room looks dated and could do with some dating,neg
water pressure and temperature is inconsistent,neg
mosquitoes,neg
sound induration is not that good can hear neighbors talking and sounds of to from their room,neg
the only negative thing is that the hotel was not so close to all the shops and parties we needed a taxi every day to go and come back otherwise the rest was perfect  great stuff  only the manager was speaking good english the stuff was very kindest they barely spoke english,neg
nothing was just great,neg
too noisy at evening time stayed  days nobody clean my room even after asking do so in morning time,neg
don’t make guests wait  minutes at checkout so you can check the minimal  it implies you don’t trust them when they say they haven’t used it,neg
the room was tiny so small we had to keep our luggage in the bathroom the only window was also in the bathroom which made the room feel like a cell i dont think all rooms were like this and it was listed as an economy room but for what we paid it was pretty poor,neg
all prices in the hotel are excluding  service charge and  vat door of shower wasn’t able to closefitness rather tinted a bit quickly,neg
we booked and paid for a sea villa through bookingcom for  adults and  children ages  and  this was clear on our booking when we arrived at the hotel after hours of travelling we were told that maximum occupancy of the room was  people we argued this for a while and even though they could see on the booking that the requirement was for a family of  they would not let us check in without paying a surcharge for the th person with  tired children and no option we had to pay when we got to the room the room had a large double bed and a huge sofa bed so it could easily accommodate all of us so we thought we would not let it spoil our holiday and take the matter up with bookingcom when we returned from our trip to our disappointment bookingcom were less then helpful and have said that the hotel were in their right to do this even though our booking clearly stated  adults and  children so beware when you are booking that you may be subject to additional charges might be best to book through the hotel direct in future to clarify if you will be charged extra for the fourth person,neg
nothing all was good,neg
needs undoing and deep clean walls were stained and duets too,neg
cost of private taxi to town,neg
its in a very quiet neighbourhood not so pretty,neg
the beach is not the best nor is the water the clearest but it makes up for it was its quickness would definitely go back,neg
distance from my room to beach is far so for such party if cart support available could be better,neg
the room just was not clean  had to call and ask for housekeeping to come clean the room  the toilet was blocked  there was a gap on the front door where bags would come in  there was a cockroaches in the room when we checked in  the shower curtain was yellow at the bottom  it needs a serious scrub it’s disgusting how i clean the room was,neg
the room was dusty hair left by previous guests had to run after housemaid for towels after she had taken the used ones every day the ladder of the pool was set much too high although we had rooms with direct access of the pooldeluxe room the pool was hardly used due to the ladder nearly impossible to get out of it our iron was hardly working deposit was  b which was very steep,neg
very bad internet  better if they not offer internet instead of a connection like this,neg
small pool but its ok for me expensive taxi around the island,neg
negative thingsroom and bed size wife breakfast in room to channels,neg
lack of mosquito net despite room pick housekeeping not at its best unless you tip enough air conditioning too noisy to leave it overnight so then too hot staff very nice and polite but their english is yet to improve,neg
staff was not that helpful,neg
prompt response  help would have been appreciated,neg
wife didn work,neg
i however didn’t find that it was worth the money i paid for it didn’t get anything out of it which was a big disappointment and extra fees i had to pay which weren’t mentioned to me before my arrival and as i left,neg
the many crazy giant bags that were hanging out by our door and halfway mostly at night the wizards that lived in our room,neg
far from chewing taxi is expensive the beach across the road and it also under construction,neg
restaurant and bar are quite poor quality not signed with pricking room needs more maintenance especially restroom and terrace,neg
small rooms,neg
rooms were smell full if damp and dirty,neg
the beds are very hard,neg
the restaurant does have coffee and coronet water but no began healthy option either fried or meat  it is ok though because across the street is an amazing indian restaurant,neg
when we turned on the water it had some kind of funny smell the receptions could be more polite to the guests,neg
better coffee in rooms and more wardrobe space,neg
breakfast was very basic and could have been better,neg
could have provided free or discount scuttle services may be,neg
unattractive swimming pool,neg
bungalows were very close to each other,neg
a coffee machinekettle in the room would have been perfect,neg
a bit too far from town bathroom too dark,neg
the hotel was nothing like it looked in pictures online its old and the room we got was not cleaned the bathroom was too dark the whole room had a very strong mold smell it was so strong i had to sleep with a face mask on as i have bad galleries to dust and mold i couldn sleep their anymore i decided to check out the next day even though i have paid for  nights i told the manager about the problem she got very upset it seemed and all the front desk girls gave us weird stares and we didn feel welcomed their we didn get a refund but i said screw it i will go elsewhere where i can feel comfortable and not get giggler coming from the girls at front desk i think the hotel needs a lot off work and they need to do something about the mold dusky smell,neg
no sun loungers on beach but plenty others at nearby restaurant you can use if you buy a drink or meal we lay on the beach with towels worth noting i dont think the accommodation provides beach towels but we had our own and the sand was soft,neg
a little far from the center,neg
i cannot really fault this property its absolutely beautiful maybe just the fact it is  minutes from most places like the airport and fisherman village,neg
a bit far from the city however the hotel offer for free scuttle bus  or  times a day,neg
the food in the restaurant can be better very small quantities,neg
the breakfast is great though,neg
not so close to white beach,neg
the place needs a lot of maintenancelooking very tired and even ruby,neg
the floor of the room was dirty a terrible noise from parties until  in the morning more hostel than hotel not suitable for those looking for quiet,neg
slow foundry service room were clean but needed an update,neg
the rudestmost unfriendly people in the hospitality industry and in thailand all work here,neg
its also far from everything in oh same and not good breakfast,neg
no complaints here,neg
was mislead about family room near pool had to pay to upgrade up a very very steep hill food was very poor sister hotel food was outstanding,neg
no proper beach to swim in  the so called free massage were done with clothes on at one point when asked for a  bottle of wine to take back to the room there was no stock when i complained to the manager he said he placed an order for  bottles  they were coming in  weeks  he said he’d get me one “outside” for a very “good” price this is supposed to be a  star hotel  and there were bull ants in the condiments staff in reception didn’t seem to know a lot about their surroundings to give the tourist any into no entertainment especially at night or activities hotel stuck out away from everything at least  mind to half hour scuttle to anything,neg
there is no water everyday while we are showering was told maintenance was doing some work but there is no ratification to guests we need to call and check terrible experience to shower halfway without water sometimes the staff is not even aware there is no water,neg
the massage inside was so so but plenty of massage option along the beach or on the backside street,neg
the shower was too confusing there were  shower one an electric one and one from the mains you count adjust the temperature on either so the electric shower was always boiling  the mains was always cold we had to have both on to get a warm shower lifts to hotel rooms this was fine for us but this hotel is not suitable for anyone with mobility problemsalthough there are signs up saying no organs our fridge sunk of them,neg
this was perfect no complaints here,neg
if you need to iron anything you need to do it in the hotel lobby also we had lots of bags in our room ants and mosquitoes i know sometimes you can’t help with the mosquitoes but we had so many,neg
bathroom could be betteronline the room stated it had a bath but it did notalso states the room has a tumble dwyer but it does not more european breakfast option and a little more variety for breakfast needed,neg

frog in room drains smelled water pressure in shower terrible,neg
polar a little bit expensive,neg
restaurant  service  very slow,neg
wife has been broken for a long timetoilet seat was on the floorair conditioning was good for  de next door disco finished at  am,neg

hard to find something we didn like,neg
the bar fridge did not worked to get a bucket and ice every night,neg
the toilet was a bit smell it must be from the drainage,neg
the room size is ok quality and amenities is so so  staff is not very friendly or just the reception i met  the price you are paying is really for the location,neg
the main road which is very busy  noisy runs right behind the house spoiling the beach atmosphere  tranquility very limited budget eating places in the immediate area  resort and beach restaurant prices do not cater for budget travel having a few decently prices standard local dishes like padthai or rice nodules dishes plus unfordable bees would bring in way much more restaurant support,neg
better service very far away from main strip there was no separate shampoo or conditioned no toothbrush or amnesty packs,neg
there is a problem with the ac at the hotel,neg
too dark at night time,neg
the beach area was under renovation,neg
customer service  and the insect in the hotel,neg
restaurant staff were invisible at times could learn a lot from receptions and manager on duty food at the hotel a bit expensive but resort situated quite close to amenities where you can grab a bite to eat,neg

a lot of traffic noiseuntill midnitethe balcony was very hot  from ac unit,neg
the beach was not very clean would have liked the private beach to be more cleaner,neg
nothing to dislike except the noise from the clubs but they have some quiet rooms,neg
room not ready until   not particularly clean a plate of unfinished food sat on the stairs to our room level for  hoursprobably the biggest problem is the paths and steps smooth marble type surfaces which were very slippery we had  falls in our group and were told of several more and the steps were uneven in sizeheight many without handrails,neg
a bit far from the center but it is also an advantage,neg
we had problem with previous transport despite we advise hotel sap refuse to refund even a small amount not polite more understanding of the situation sad for such price and for a genius client,neg
the beds are a bit hard,neg
the atmosphere at the bar and restaurant could have been better there was also a large unused space next to the restaurant with a few chairs spread around that did not add any value probably better if they had a pool table or something interesting there the to could have been placed better instead of stuffed in a corner given that we never watched to or even spent much time in the room it was not an inconvenience i also felt the breakfast lacked a little lymph,neg
fantastic roomier good service pool in front of the room,neg
small and old room,neg
the pool need to be cleaner  the water is not right,neg
restaurant quite expensive but there is so much around you dont need to worry about this,neg
we had asked for two properties next to each other and for our first stay we stayed one night moved to oh to and came back for three nights there were in different blocks,neg
water in shower is very hard to control between hot and cold air condition engine is at the balcony not cool,neg
the room was not very clean at check in,neg
the beds and pillows smelled of humidity which was not comfortable at all,neg
there was an unpleasant smell in the toilet,neg
the seating area in the balcony was not clean dirt under the pillows which was a shame because it was beautiful,neg
the hotel scuttle from the airport was only  mind and because i booked through bookingscom the hotel charged  bath for the transfer which is quite expensive considering the hotel room was  bath the hotel is very near to the airport which made it convenient for me because i only spent one night but it is directly under the flight path,neg
the room was tiny and not overlay clean there was constant noise throughout the night which made sleeping difficult,neg
exclusive beautiful and private,neg
nothing about hotel but the restaurant around are not so high quality,neg
pool area too small and no pool umbrella,neg
him prices at the restaurant where pretty heavy,neg
the sea is rather should with rocky bottom if you want to bath in the sea it is better to find another beach,neg
the staff had a noisy cart or wheeled contraction that was noisy early in morning and an alarm of sorts  and after a big night  a little grease would be handy,neg
i loved everything there could not fault it at all,neg
nothing this is a disadvantage that there is no disadvantage,neg
couldn fault the property,neg
we had to move rooms during our stay and were not so keen on being moved from rd floor with sea view to ground floor,neg
management should maintain property better lacks sheen at places,neg
ac is very noisy,neg
would have been nice to have an adults only pool,neg
location and smelt bad,neg
a little bit to much use of concrete in the architecture,neg
if you can not serve water to your guest his may it be paid or not you should not run a hotel refusing your customer paid or free water at  midnight and saying that you will provide it in the next morning is either you are joking or you are misbehavingfor this reason i am highly highly highly unhappy and it made is worst when i was further refused to escort me to the main wanted to get water from  eleven from my room by there pulled car which is used internally all the lights were turned off which is also very funny at that time and it was not possible to walk through the passage which is through the forest this is required because its a hill placed hotel we felted like we are placed in a jail although after not stop lagging he sent a security guard with torch light to walk through forest to the main gate,neg
staff where not very nice,neg
the housekeeping could have been done a bit more thorough,neg
to the minutes can be attributed to the poor speed of the internet but i was told that this is the trouble on the whole island,neg
nichtsfyi it kinderwagen nicht geeignet weren den violent stolen da hotel am hang eleven ist,neg
nice beach but crowed not enough plugs in the room,neg
place was stunning,neg
i wish i could stay longer,neg
prices at the restaurant and bars inside the resort may be a little lower,neg
a lot of noise until  am however that what you also expect when you stay in the center of chawengseemed like everything went off the book,neg
there was construction on the beach that was noisy although it was beyond their control,neg
could have done with a lift you need some strong legs to get up to the top floor,neg
no wife unless at front office bed very hard,neg
the size of the room was too small for us along with our bags making it hard to move around the room and get in and out of bed the room window looked straight into another window so our curtains were often closed for privacy,neg
taxi to airport expensive,neg
wife not strong enough  nearly no reception in room,neg
the shower kept going hot and cold not a consistent temperature,neg
the prices at the restaurant and bar were a little bit overpriced but there are many cheaper option nearby,neg
considering we were wrapped indoors we watched a lot of to the to was a little old and didn’t work very well but if the sun is shining you would never even put the to on so this is not anything to put anyone of would stay again,neg
the resort location is a bit too far drink and restaurant a bit too prices,neg
not many option to go out or have dinner out not very appropriate for groups of friends its more like a quiet place for families or couples,neg
wife dropped out every minute and it was really annoying towels were really old and gripped would have expected better from such a place breakfast was very average for the price you pay,neg
i stayed there for  days and it was totally waste of money,neg
at first you dont get any wife on the checking they just say that its a temporary problem and will be fixed soon  but it never happens so if you need internet during your stay  avoid this hotel,neg
the next thing is water if you like to take a shower  there will be so poor water pressure that you can wash at all,neg
the beach if you want to swim in the sea  avoid this hotel there is a smell river right near the hotels beach and you will taste a lot of sticky smells and tastes while swimming,neg
the snakes if you dont like wild snakes  stay away from this hotel were seen  times snakes right near our room i attach some photo,neg
and finally you will be attacked with mosquitoes during all your stay there,neg
dont forget that there is nothing around the hotel in  minutes walk,neg
flight was slightly late and i couldn see the hotel driver waiting so i called and they said they will check and asked me to call back in  minutes i spent over € on accommodation and they can even phone me back after they find their driver turns out he was in the toilet so that why i missed him not a problem but really cheap of the hotel to ask me to call back checking took forever after that and the carry on with the credit card nonsense and having the same one as the booking etc not a pleasant experience after flying  hours i even paid for an extra night the night before so i could check in right away in the morning  i couldn sleep well at all the room next door had a loud clock and the ac was always too strong or too noisy really thick bed covers too why,neg
very little to dislike but if anything a little expensive on drinks and high hotel tax added but you get what you pay for most vs had problems but you dont come to a place like this to watch to unless your ill,neg
we had booked a hill room with garden view  and there were a lot of steps up to our room this was ok for us but if you are limited in mobility or have small children with bulges etc make sure to request a room closer to the reception area with pool view,neg
breakfast was adequate but nothing special,neg
everything was great,neg
restaurant was a bit expensive however locally just at the entrance to the resort there is a great little restaurant called terrace which serves amazing food at great prices also a great cafe about  minutes walk right next to the nearest,neg
the breakfast was disappointing covered in fly’s,neg
internet barely works very inconvenient if you need to rely on it for anything location is good but a bit far from the main street  shopping  restaurant area a taxi will cost you us each way hotel has no grm description states “airport scuttle” which is not free description states “canning” but that is not offered at the hotel,neg
nothing negative only positive feelings and memories,neg
the apartments are slightly out of town in comparison to those right on the beach however the apartments do offer a free scuttle bus into town during the day,neg
only down side is the location which is on the main road pp  mind walk to the beach though they will take you down to the beach by car if requested,neg
nothing was literally perfect,neg
limited variety of breakfast menu but mummy still,neg
nothing everything was perfect,neg
everything was perfect,neg
busy roads of oh same,neg
wife was not good very intermittent,neg
its on a bit of a hill,neg
overpriced lunchsmall pool,neg
poor management team,neg
the beach could be tidied on a more regular basis but i understand this is a shared beach not just for the hotel,neg
dirty ants no internet connection no skyward change the name of the hotel,neg
the villas are not really private people walking by can see inside the room and can see the pool very clearly their pools are not temperature controlled even though they are small so the water was so called we could not swim in the villa pool food was not good in the hotel restaurant and i had a food poisoning on the rd day breakfast,neg
the triple room has no view at all very dark could not find beach front bungalow so i checked out,neg
whole resort needs some tic a bit shabby in places which means it is not value for money the resort is also divided in two with an awkward path between the areas thank goodness for onion on site as otherwise it is not really a great place,neg
i found that the restaurant was expensive compared to the tree house nest door to them,neg
the staff are extremely polite but their very basic english can present difficulties at times the pool is rather small and quickly gets overrun by families with children breakfast option are a bit limited and become repetition after  days housekeeping could be improved  for instance our terrace jacuzzi want cleaned a single time during our night stay,neg
la liveried,neg
nothing at moment,neg
shutters to other areas of the island could be more frequent,neg
due to the high prices especially compared to the restaurant and bars outside unfortunately the restaurant and the bar was emotion every night despite live music that is a pity,neg
water not hot enough for shower,neg
open air bathroom not good for mosquitoes,neg
we had a superb stay at blue arched however on a couple of occasions the water turned a bit muddy not sure if this was just a one off as it seemed to resolve itself fairly quickly,neg
wife kept dropping out spoke to front desk a number of times but not able to fix it only happened in room rest of property was fine,neg
i stayed there for  days and it was totally waste of money,neg
at first you dont get any wife on the checking they just say that its a temporary problem and will be fixed soon  but it never happens so if you need internet during your stay  avoid this hotel,neg
the next thing is water if you like to take a shower  there will be so poor water pressure that you can wash at all,neg

and finally you will be attacked with mosquitoes during all your stay there,neg
dont forget that there is nothing around the hotel in  minutes walk,neg
pillows were a bit too big and stiff,neg
we booked and paid for a sea villa through bookingcom for  adults and  children ages  and  this was clear on our booking when we arrived at the hotel after hours of travelling we were told that maximum occupancy of the room was  people we argued this for a while and even though they could see on the booking that the requirement was for a family of  they would not let us check in without paying a surcharge for the th person with  tired children and no option we had to pay when we got to the room the room had a large double bed and a huge sofa bed so it could easily accommodate all of us so we thought we would not let it spoil our holiday and take the matter up with bookingcom when we returned from our trip to our disappointment bookingcom were less then helpful and have said that the hotel were in their right to do this even though our booking clearly stated  adults and  children so beware when you are booking that you may be subject to additional charges might be best to book through the hotel direct in future to clarify if you will be charged extra for the fourth person,neg
the sea along the beach is not suitable for swimming because the water stays very low all day but this is common issue of all hotels in chawengi knew about it and i was not surprised,neg
no pool false advertising,neg
the walls are rather thin and i could hear conversations coming from next door through no fault of the hotel some party goes came back next door at am and were clearly full of spirits after  mind i knocked on their door and told them to be quiet and they obliged,neg
the pool at the hotel is very small and not deep enough for me to even bother however this wouldn put me off staying here again,neg
had to wait more than  minutes for transfer from airport to hotel,neg
bed wasn’t comfortable,neg
our room was quite dated in comparison to the newer huts at the front of the resort beach was not amazing not within close proximity of many other amenities hotel did offer a free scuttle service to chawengother areas,neg
cleanliness,neg
nothing bad to say about this place,neg
it was a little noisy but that what you get choosing a location so close to the nighttime,neg
the hotel advertised a buffets breakfast included with your room rate however they don’t actually do breakfast so false advertisement really also said our room had a balcony and it didn’t also thought the room was quite overpriced for what you get,neg
giant spider in our room so many mosquitoes because of cracks between windows bed was hard shower had no curtain so water got all over the bathroom far away from town expensive for what you get,neg
chairs on the cottage veranda were very uncomfortable,neg
some staff rigid on simple requests also breakfast could be better fresh juice had sugar in it and the staff were silent on it when i asked them to make me fresh juice they actually poured some sweetened juice into it clandestine,neg
the price per night does vary quite a lot the porches and balconies of two building are just a few peters apart and face each other this can be uncomfortable if you dont like other guests staring at you from both sides as you walk to your room or find someone looking at you at night as you open the balcony depends on the other guests we didn notice this issue last time,neg
rooms a little small and dark could have done with more cupboard space for clothes and somewhere to sit in the room other than the bed,neg
drinks were quite price when not of happy hour,neg
resort needs renovation,neg
beach villa was great but out of date,neg
beds were uncomfortable far too hard,neg
too many mosquitoes no effective measures,neg
noisy building work going on with dust blowing around from cutting concrete,neg
even allowing for christmas the price was almost prohibitive and not one i would consider again were it not for our honeymoon couple of mix up over you booking and lack of hot water took the edge off an excellent stay and the up selling of wine and events was all a bit unsavoury,neg
from day  ratio to balcony wouldn lock problem with main door not locking to reception poor although they did fix after  days  air con blowing warm air,neg
noisy crickets and wizards but they are everywhere in same,neg
too many steps to the beach  poor service on beach,neg
we arrived at  and had to wait over an hour for check after a long day travelling it was a big let down,neg
very flies door lock no safety deposit box not actually on the beach the swimming pool advertised is just a hot tub so many rules and regulations for example they can access your room at any time without notice i woke up to maintenance work being done in the bungalow next to me at am all of the plugs were hanging off bed sheets were stained and were old and wobbly,neg
don’t get the basic room upgrade to standard double with balcony,neg
the street suffer at the hotel was a disappointment,neg
not a great place to meet people,neg
with was very poor,neg
wife was terrible and only worked periodically room was very basic and was not like the pictures portray and not at all good value for money,neg
the bed was way to hard terrible there are no come chairs to sit in in the room,neg
rooms are in need of dating the hotel was reasonably prices however it is very much in the busy end of chewing and m or so from the very lively ark bar despite this the hotel is very quiet and the little bungalows in the garden are nice,neg
very loud in the rooms located close of street pool with stones instead of times  dangerous for legs and hands some rooms share balcony with neighbours,neg
good hotel but too expensive for that quality,neg
there no lightning in the shower place it’s dark if you take shower in the evening there is no place to hang  to dry the towels,neg
wife kept going on and off,neg
not a thing,neg
mattress too firm safe didn work and staff were rude when informed of same,neg
the longer cushions need replacing funny smell from drain in bathroom shower not for single travelers at all all the tables in restaurant set up for couples only which is very corn gives a contrived sense of happiness only for those who like that sort of thing the bar lounge is never occupied and seems a waste of space could be better used for something else,neg
rooms were crazy small nowhere to put suitcase,neg
the room key cards weren ready until pm so  had to ask a member of staff to leave you into your room each time,neg
only thing that may of been an issue is ants there was a collection of them around the table however we realised being in asia this is a common problem but felt more can be done to address the amount,neg
the bed want too soft,neg
we arrived to oh same on january  and needed to stay in oh same because there was a storm and we could not take a boat to oh pagan our original destination we stayed in cost hotel  nights and decided to move to pavilion resort to a bigger room with a balcony we made a reservation for  nights since we were told that there will not be boats to oh pagan in the next  days after one day we could go to oh pagan and we asked the hotel to cancel  night they refused  we know they could refund us for  night since the resort marya in oh pagan suggested to make a  refund for   nights since we arrived  days later because of the storm pavilion hotel did not feel they have to this is disappointing in addition the information they gave us with regards to the time table and availability of the boats to oh pagan was wrong the balcony was a closed one with no view outside,neg
the choice at breakfast,neg
the new years eve buffets,neg
the turn down service,neg
the beds had springs poking through them which was pretty uncomfortable but for  a night i want mad about it  its a bit of a far walk to a part of the beach where you can actually hang out but i drove down there and marked at one of the resorts every day so it was alright the shower also agent the best its just a short those connected to the tap so to wash your hair you have to lean over and the shower doors wouldn really close so sometimes it got mess there is definitely room for upgrade as they evolve but for the price point though i felt content being there  and the sweet goodheartedness of the owners was the best part they are just a wonderful pair of people,neg
bar prices were expensive,neg
not much to fault in general but the fried eggs for breakfast were a tiny bit undercooked on days we were there its easy enough to advise the chef to cook it further though,neg
the food was a little prices for me good value by hotel prices for the island and it looked great but i prefer eating in local arteries,neg
being a  hour flight away,neg
we were unlucky with the weather as it poured with rain for most of our stay  we had a very expensive beachside bungalow with a pool which i used in the rain  we had no dry towels from early one morning until  pm the next day and as it was so wet was very disappointing  we were stuck in the room with only two coffee pads for that time  repairs were being done in the bungalow next door so we could hear drilling and sawing  no really what you expect when you have paid so much for a room  when we mentioned it to reception we were told that the manager would speak to us on check out  when we mentioned it on check out we were told that he had already spoken to us he hadn we asked for his name and were told we can give you that  eventually the manager came to find us and was very pleasant and refused £ out of the £ we paid for three nights and two days  we wouldn return to this hotel  we have stayed in many places in thailand and this is the only time we have been really disappointed,neg
no complaints the only thing that made me a little uneasy was when you check in  they sit you down away from the counter and you they bring the paperwork to you that was fine but then they ask for your credit card and take that back to the counter that made me feel quite uncomfortable as in always conscious of having my card scanned by a summer  i couldn see where my card was while they had it  i think they should offer you the opportunity to go with them to the counter and give them your card there and then,neg
the swimming pool is probably nice but was under construction for the duration of our stay without any prior notice from the hotel the wife was not working for  out of our  nights stay,neg
breakfast food was scarce and pans were empty often you can hear the bass of the music from the bars down the way all night though we managed to sleep if you are afraid of dogs or cats they are every where personally i thought they were cut the beach is a little puff at times there are more areas with protective comes if you prefer though th water is not as clear there bed may be to hard for some,neg
beach side place very small,neg
too hot in the room at night but to be expected for the time of year and price,neg
evening meals could have been a bit better,neg
room  very small,neg
breakfast is good in that standards but there might have been a bit more variety for international travellers,neg
just an advice to anyone visiting same be aware of taxi drivers  it might worth to arrange pick driver from hotel in order to avoid all the haste of negotiation and intention of lipping you off,neg
bathroom smelt like a fewer  despite cleaning staff lighting tea light candles daily with eucalyptus oil the smell could not be masked  it is obviously a known problem  bathroom door and window were not framed and they needed a good clean shower pressure just awful  just small points but they make a difference to the overall feeling,neg
the staff was not very friendly also very expensive prices of food and drinks compared to average prices on oh same not very good breakfast for star resort they could use for local food esp fruits,neg
really nothing bad to say here well done if i had to pick something its a little bit of a tree to the main road from the resort but i guess that the payoff for beachfront ocean views but with looters bites and taxes this is still not an issue,neg
the beautiful beach of this hotel is used as a location for wedding photo on a daily bases so there always a bride blocking your sunset that in itself i can live with not with the loud tack  songs the photographer is playing while working the same damn onya song in a loop for over an hour because the bride likes it is close to torture this happened all  nights i stayed there,neg
the airconditioning was not working on the first night we arrived to the resort so we had to sleep the night in the heat and it was not comfortable also we did not have enough privacy in our private pool as the room front of us could see us everytime they went in and out of their room,neg
everything was great i initially booked a room with no view but they upgrade me when i told them i would prefer a better view they just wanted to make my holiday great loved it,neg
if i have any suggestions it would be to supply a kettle in the rooms or at least give guests access to boiling water  i like to make a cup of coffee in the mornings and this would have made the stay much nicer,neg
everything was great except for the noise from the cars at night as our room was right in front of the main road,neg
the beach is very nice but the water is a bit rough with heavy waves sometimes so swimming and anorceling is not always possible,neg
microwave didn work  really didn matter,neg
only thing is the bed wasn’t very come and we had a mosquito problem  had to have it sprayed,neg
room was run down internal doors to the pool area were hard to open door handle to entry of room loose times in plunge pool rough and borrowed air conditioning making loud cracking sound and kept iting up and spitting ice and water onto coincidently only whilst sleeping we did have one of the maintenance men look at this but problem still occurred and i didn want to complain king size bed that  singles pushed together very uncomfortable for a couple really expected clot more from this hotel considering the price of the room was very high beach out front of resort not nice rocky shallow sixty sand,neg
nothing at all,neg
bath room  absolute disaster  corrosive on caps in bath and sink animals smell,neg
room  most horrible bed we ever had  feels like we are sleeping on floor after  night we were willing to check out but property charge you immediately after check in without let you first see the room  not refundable  even when they had every day free room declared on bookingcom available  they refused to change our room,neg
bedding was not changed for several days we need to ask for that,neg
from balcony we had every morning nice view for truck which came to pick septic,neg
wife  if somebody believe it will be high speed internet we were happy if it was some time possible to get connected property policy  which they will give you immediately after check in will explain you that it is not ensued,neg
breakfast  another poor performance bread and bread rolls covered with part of curtains dirty not washed every day used  poor selection,neg
swimming pool  was full of sun lotions for  days stay we did not saw anybody to clean it water was not exchanged at all,neg
no things,neg
the rooftop bar although looks great and was generally a pro was really overpriced for drinks,neg
want anything i didn like,neg
a bit overpriced for the service they provided they are serving really tactless coffee for breakfast forcing you to order a proper one at the bar,neg
the grm closes at  the swimming pool closes at  what is the reason behind no one could answer,neg
the receptions who pulled a knife on us when checking in,neg
as we was in low season there was nothing much around if you dont have sooner or car,neg
i requested for a cot which was delivered broken and was far too small for the baby i had it removed few hours after our arrival after it collapsed when i placed baby inside i did not even get a refund it was not a free service,neg
also the pictures and description of the pool are  not accurate it is very small and not a chance to swim there wont take more than  person at a time assuming you are not moving more looking like a jacuzzi without the features to me,neg
not a thing,neg
far from everything and restaurant and massage are too expensive,neg
the  toilet water have some smell,neg
its quite noisy from the main road course you can hear the airplane which didn bother us too much,neg
friendly staff,neg
the bathroom was horrible unfortunately because the rest of the room was lovely,neg
poor wife connections,neg
poor beach no facilities  bad beach restaurant,neg
unfortunately i did not get a great room which was allocate to the road of the shops which was not what i expected i also requested a new room and they were not able to help me i am in  mind if i would book there due to service,neg
staffs english was also not that great for me to understand or explain myself,neg
a little far away from where all the action is but you can rent a sooner,neg
staff did not appear friendly or helpful quality of the food could be better,neg
the food and drinks were overpriced and extremely poor quality their staff did not respond to room cleaning requests and most of them barely spoke englishexcept the receptions we were charged far more than the market price in chewing for a drink which was served in a small glass and that too only half a glass picture attached it baffled us and on approaching the ff manager he refused to do anything the rooms have old furniture smell musty and the bathroom was smell with leaking caps and lack of proper drainage both on the floor and the basin there was no shower curtain for the bathtubs and that led to the bathroom flooding everytime we took a shower the facilities and the staff are pathetic and the price paid seems almost like a burglars never booking through bookingcom and returning to as resort again,neg
arrived st the hotel for  nights at check in i explained i needed to go to the hospital as i had a back  knee injury they told me to pay for  nights and the manager would refund me when she arrived because i required a few nights in hospital manager arrived and left us waiting from pp telling us her manager switched his phone off so couldn’t refund part of our stay asked to change rooms to ground floor no such thing lots of slopes  steps to room so i was in a lot of pain the next morning i was in so much pain we had to check out after  night and go to the hospital to fly home early the hotel refused to even offer us a partial refund after telling us to pay and the manager would refund they didn’t want to help despite they could see joe much pain i was in plunge pool freezing cold and swimming pool filthy,neg
nothing property is perfect for the price,neg
paid over £ a night to stay in this hotel and wish i had not  they put my family and i in one of there old rooms which was well overdue a return  the air con kept us up all night sounded like a diese engine  when we asked them to fix it they didn’t  they eventually after  days of us asking moved us upstairs into one of there newly returned rooms  better but very small  the pools are filthy and some of the staff are surly  there’s a lot better hotels for that sort of money in oh same  gutted,neg
the place is a little dated for the money they are asking very average breakfast,neg
very different from the pictures,neg
room not cleaned properly,neg
very very noisy  lots of construction work all around ants everywhere in bathroom standard room much smaller than appears on bookingcom,neg
everything fine the staff speak not so good english,neg
queen sized bed was two beds pushed together leaving what felt like a bar in the center of the bed,neg
pool was too close to surrounding guests many times was swimming in the pool with friends and had guests ask us to please quiet down were trying to read,neg
the restaurant was poor quality and staff need supervision  deposit for pool towels seems petty for the standard of the hotel,neg
no wife in room now installed but weak few english to channels,neg
not enough seats available at the pool,neg
rooms are way smaller than what they show you on photo,neg
staff at the dining area are quite dismissive the food was small portions and overpriced not a big enough menu or many healthy option,neg
on main road but a little far from the centre of town,neg
grm area sticky and in need of maintenance mattress a little hard not ideal location for spontaneous ventures into town,neg
our bed was a little squeaky if you made any movement,neg
rooftop bar not open wife was terrible,neg
nothing negative,neg
nothing in particular about the hotel itself  but the surrounding area has few interesting things to do,neg
attitude of some employees,neg
right terrible rude staff offcourse i complain every time when first day my bed was broken then second room iron didn work properly  no cooling nought not only my room others also first room was great but broken bed the worst was i pay for  people  you have to registered the second one with passport at otherwise you have to pay for all crazy i pay for  people then every day complain about iron and offcourse i dont want to change my room over again and again i dint came to the resort like that to change room every day your rooms should be ready check out was the nightmare i wanted to extended my stay but no thank you with this rude staff one time if you will know how to treat clients your hotel can be really good done fix your rooms change beds and staffs and  you will be perfect,neg
we ate at a both men sand beach restaurant and saffron restaurant and as expected it was fairly expensive by that standards although probably similar to other high class hotels and resorts quality and service good,neg
one staff member was very unfriendly,neg
everything is above and beyond service is excellent breakfast is amazing and i would like the bed and pillows to be the same in my housethe italian restaurant outside the hotel is very bad and in my opinion makes a bad name to the hotel the food was disappointing and all  of us which ate there had felt bad after eating there,neg
absolutely nothing,neg
a hotel dont have a lift so inconvenient for heavy or large luggage or elder people,neg
less to channel to watch,neg
a swimming pool small size about x so inconvenient for really swimming  swimming in a sea is a better choice,neg
lot of car park about   cars so should let a hotel know before check in if you had a car but on my time to stay here didn had a problem to park a car,neg
dont have any convenient store or reasonable price restaurant close to a hotel  so if you didn had a car or motorcycle inconvenient to walk out side by your self  should take a hotel van scuttle service or take a taxi that away park front of a hotel so if you would like to go to  that delicious food restraints that was recommended in same island it far away from a hotel about  along a way from a hotel to lamp beach road,neg
not much to dislike  except for the weather which was terrible for  days due to the massive cycling which hit oh same on fro and sat,neg
no lift but the lovely receptions helped me with my bag some noisy neighbours shouting in the halls too but not the hotels fault,neg
swimming pool is not deep enough for adults and is closed at,neg
attentiveness of the staffpool m cm deepfood breakfast,neg
glass on the beach  children couldn play,neg
if you are looking for delicious cocktail not recommended,neg
first room we received had no hot water and had bed bags took some convincing to move rooms but they finally moved us to a new place which was clot better when complaining about an extra  bath to travel via taxi about  minute drive the staff under breath called me an american pretty brazen  remark and totally impolite when asking questions he would just repeat himself so i would need to ask the question again and again the usual manger is nice so its disappointing that others have ruined the overall experience and impression with his singing personality and snake comments and gestures the rude staff also made a deal with a local taxi to overcharge us then lied to me and my wife about our next hotel charging bath to go up the mountain which we had to pay the taxi driver it was very suspicious i assume he split the money he extorted from us with the taxi driver i hope the pavilion can train there staff to be honest and not to take advantage of there customers and to learn to ask questions and educate themselves before giving shock advice,neg
we stayed in the beachfront pool villa which was absolutely amazing just wish they had built the wall a bit higher so it could be more private as everyone swimming can see,neg
bathroomtoilet with no odour outlet outdated to set with ridiculously poor image what use is such a to beach partially ruined by jetskis and other noisy and pouting activities,neg
the food was ok without being spectacular staff missed up orders a couple times and had trouble understanding basic english,neg
nothing that i would say was not liked,neg
the location is bit far away from the center area where you can find nighttime so is needed transport to move,neg
we stopped here  years ago definitely needs a lick of paint,neg
most of the room are in the other side of the main hotel  so when you need to go to beach or reception you have to gross the highway,neg
do not stay here my friend and i chose to stay here for a clean relaxing experience after staying at hostess for over a month we were told upon arrival that the infinity pool at the resort was only for guests who booked a certain type of exclusive room  which is not what it says online the staff was very unfriendly and rude when we said we only booked because of the infinity pool and would not accommodate us at all,neg
the rooms were small and very dirty you could not even the the sign on the toilet saying to flush because of all the rust and dirt the planes fly directly over the hotel starting early in the morning  incredibly loud and disruption impossible to relax or sleep the bathroom had an odour when we arrived that seemed to never leave the power went out as well as the generation for a while leaving us completely in the dark,neg
instead of staying here spend a bit more money to book a nice hotel or just stay at a hostel we regret staying here most hostess we stayed at for a much lower price were much friendliest cleaner and had nicer facilities,neg
far from lamp center,neg
no complaints,neg
no issues at all  the only thing which the hotel will be unable to do anything about there were a lot of steps and combined with the heat were sometimes exhausting,neg
everything was perfect,neg
i stayed  days i see a wizard on the wall in first days night i couldn reach anybody because lobby close  pm they changed my room in second day i had more beautiful room but there was again a wizard on the wall at night i never suggest somebody this hotel it is no different from worst rent,neg
was not really anything to complain about  drinks and food from hotel very overpriced but that seems to be the case in most,neg
room was extremely small for  people beds were not separate and there was no space at all,neg
area was very quite so not the best if you are looking for a lively area not really walking distance to places if you like to go shopping centre etc you could hire a motorbike for cheap though no western style breakfast choice couldn’t book ferries at the hotel,neg
unfortunately the room was very dirty and we found many cockroaches in the bathroom they were going everywhere so you could not leave anything in the bathroom or any luggage open,neg
you are asked to remove your shoes in the restaurant area nothing strange for the region but there were many dirty dogs walking around were you are asked to walk bared food,neg
the rooms were noisy when people above moved chairs or furniture perhaps some felt on the the legs of chairs and tablesthe resort needs to be spruce up with cracked concrete areas needing repair and a few wooden palings etc needing repair and some areas in need of painting,neg
the place is slightly outdated although spotless clean could use a little refurbishment also a better schedule for the scuttle to lamp would help furthermore i didn like that i was charged for a broken bottle and i noticed a slight lack of transparent regarding prices for facilities but that is only my perspective the people out there are doing a great job overall,neg
it was a little hard to locate,neg
the view from the room was very disappointing as we paid extra for the room,neg
the welcome staff stayed in their office and just opened the glass to talk with us the bungalows are very very basic but you have at least on fridge in a separate room that looks to be a kitchen the ac was old as the other things in the bungalow and was not working well they said it is not possible to fix it you have what you pay for do not think to have a deal for that price the town is walking distance and the beach can be accessible if you cross the nice resorts on the other side of the road even it is forbidden to do so after  nights on the  repaid we decided to move for a  more expensive and comfortable resort they refused to refund the  nights even with the faulty ac on one of the bungalow i would not recommend to repaid for all your stay unless you can afford a more expensive location,neg
there was nothing that i did not like,neg
temperature of water in shower kept going from hot to cold also there no shower door so the bathroom floor tends to get wet while showering,neg
loud noise from construction site near but someday construction will end and hotel will be perfect,neg
i had to leave,neg
if i had one to pick a fault it would be with the main pool a little hay but there are  alternate smaller pools to use,neg
we certainly had  one of the worst room of the hotel by which i mean completely blank  not a single painting on the wall or any decorative object  we noticed every other villa had little shower outside to wash your feet  before going to your room of course our room didn have any  dont bother asking the receptionists for any recommendations about activities  in oh same they will simply show you all the leaflets on top of their counter last surprising thing we didn have any telephone in our room,neg
when we arrived the pool was a little dirty but was cleaned a day or so later still a great facility alsothere were so many bags in the room and it had to be sprayed with pesticide while we were staying there which left a strong chemical smell in the room,neg
if our room had a balcony it would be perfect,neg
breakfast was not included and there are not many option in the vicinity for this,neg
we dont have a problem paying for quality food but when portions salad are ridiculously small its an insult,neg
email need to be acknowledged if guests make specific requests and one is  unable to meet that clients should be given a heads up before arrival,neg
sand at beach pretty coarse,neg
the breakfast could be slightly improved as we understand that due to few customers staying at the hotel the buffets breakfast was change to pre ordering  could have done better,neg
smelt awful not clean no elevator,neg
staffs behavior,neg
management,neg
the bed was not very comfortable the mattress was very hard and the pillows were too high giving me and my girlfriend both neck ache not enough loungers around the pool if that’s where you wanted to be isn’t too much of a problem as it is located a stones throw away from the beach,neg
the only thing i can think of taxi to the airport via the hotel is  bath more expensive than a regular taxi,neg
the restaurant was rubbish and the amusement park was closed,neg
high voices difficulty to sleep its place for people who likes to party but not for me,neg
beach next to the hotel is not good there are no sun beds muddy bottom of the sea a lot of boats,neg
the staff was a bit rude compared to the other hotels in thailand during our trip we booked a snorkeling tour organized by the hotel and the company showed up three hours later so a bit miss organized,neg
breakfast finished at  but you need to arrive earlier that that as staff clear the food away at  and food not replenished close to that time good breakfast though,neg
restaurant poor for lunchdinner necessitating travelling a bit for better alternatives,neg
the staff was rude and polite the hotel rooms are not as they look in the webster and the pool and beach beds are so crowded we had to fight to get one,neg
water at the shower was unstable very hot and then very cold could not control the matters was smaller then the bed and the room looks a bit old staff at the pool want very polite,neg
staff were not overlay friendly,neg
the sheets were a bit dirty but got replaced the minute we asked for it,neg
the airplane coming over the place,neg
small room as standard the hotel far from activities,neg
nothing loved it all,neg
need to renovate the furniture,neg
we loved everything,neg
a short walk or drive from the center not such a bad thing because you earn some quiet and less crowded,neg
the floor underneath the beds was very dusty it hadn been cleaned for a long time the beach was very wavy we didn want to swim there that why the pools were a great option,neg
staffs at the reception they seriously need basic training from the beginning for example saying hello when they greet guests or even a smile at least they are the face of the resort and first impression the guests receive hardly see them smiling nor saying hello always looks angry and unhappy they shouldn be working in hospitality industry remind you they act really promptly only in regards to money  scuttle bus fee and talking about scuttle bus it is nice to see them operating one but not really happy charging fees each trip when only operate  times a day,neg
the location was a bit far from the main tourist areas,neg
and although there was a hotel scuttle it want free,neg
the beach want as nice as others on same island but at least the pool made up for it and there was no shops anywhere close to the resort,neg
and unfortunately some of the western meals in the restaurant were a bit hit and miss sorry guns,neg
nothing everything perfect,neg
sun beds were a little uncomfortable if i had to say something negative but the bean bags made up for it,neg
the description was not very clear we didn if we were supposed to be in front of the pool or notlack of entertainment like pool table etc,neg
too noisy air conditioning,neg
location close to  or two restaurant or a  minute walk down a busy road to the centre of lamp,neg
bathroom could do with an update and loungers round the pool,neg
they should do something about the dogs wandering here and there specially in the night may be by installing small gates so that the beauty of the place remains the same,neg
location a bit of a walk to central area,neg
we stayed in a bungalow with private plunge pool and while nice it was not  stars by international standards it was not worth the price we paid,neg
the beach club close by had some late night parties with very loud music which continued to  am a few times,neg
note this is out of the hotels jurisdiction,neg
the room was small no place to leave the bags,neg
view from the room was very bad,neg
breakfast option were limited and in poor condition no cooling or ice for fresh items like fruits or cheese to be kept presentable there were protection nets from bags on food items however all looked insufficient poorly presented or inaccessible eg bacon being eggs station so we have to ask for it from the staff every time and given only  pieces,neg
reaches not always clean,neg
the hotel is still amazing and worth the visit although the location is great the hotel is quite far from the airport and city center it can take min from airport to the hotel the same time to go to the main city center which can be a little expensive the motorcycle to rent in the hotel can be a good way and cheaper to move from the hotel,neg
breakfast choice could have been wider,neg
this is at bangrak beach and i would prefer staying at chewing beach comparatively but then this was so close to bangrak pier if you wish to transit to oh pagan or murat than then this place makes more sense,neg
for myself and my wife this accommodation provided for all our requirements with buffets breakfast being served until quite late it became more of a branch with eggs cooked to order and not on a hotplate plenty of choice of fruit and bread,neg
service charges added to drinks prices limited beach space available,neg
bungalow might need some minor improvements to be more come pillows too hard,neg
the per night for  to child is a bit prices,neg
watch your feet because of the prudent nails on the wooden floor,neg
cleaning price,neg
the quality of the food was not very good and was too expensive and the variety of cakes and parties in the breakfast was very limited,neg
we arrived a bit before check in so we went to the pool to relax while we waited for our rooms first they did not have any clean towels to provide us for the pool the pool is beautiful but not nearly enough seating we then went to eat at their restaurant food was good but the flies were very bothersome when we did get our room i showered to find out there were no towels in the room  they are in no hurry at this hotel,neg
witness in the restraint with the infinity pool under the star restraint was rude and had a face like thunder,neg
location was pretty dead,neg
not value for money very outdated very noisy all night would not recommend,neg
more understanding from reception staff of their guests requirements,neg
very old rooms dated should be renovated  we had g that was the only updated and nice room all the other rooms are not like in the pictures,neg
slightly hard bed can hear road noise a little from outside the room but not when inside with door shut,neg
at time of my stay pool was closed due to resurfacing i wish i knew,neg
beds were a little bit on the hard side and bit of a steep hill to walk up to the rooms but lifts up were always available,neg
it s hard to find out something wrong with this resort to be extremely perfectionist i would say the bedroom clearness can be gently improved,neg
i really cannot think of anything maybe just that it is a bit prices,neg
air condition main unit quite noisy could be disturbing even with closed doors and windows,neg
breakfast included perhaps,neg
the rooms were far from the ocean and had no view,neg
a little bit claireaudient,neg
it was perfect,neg
the grounds and rooms need a little more attention,neg
no where really to put your clothes from suitcase small hanging rail but its in the bathroom which isn ideal with all the steam from the shower and a smallish pool which i only say as i like some laws in the morning but you have the sea on your footstep and they worked with the sea they have,neg
only down side to an otherwise perfect stay was the shower it looked as though it hasn’t been cleaned in sometime and water was struggling to get though,neg
we order a family room and we get  separated room with  small childrenthe rooms was in thirds floors with no elevatorthere was a water shot of,neg
room service  wife in our room was not reliable and often did not work,neg
nothing everything was perfection,neg
the ff manager,neg
internet horriblepoor breakfasttelephones was not working during the stay inspire of reported first dayton mark on pillows and stink of moisture was on pillows and matressrenovation was continuing in many rooms and not mentioned when checked with them before booking,neg
this hotel doesn look like  star at all location is very far away from everything food is poor hear and significantly overpriced so you need to go at least  mind on bike or taxi very expensive in same for the dinner the sea is not deep so you can even swim there,neg
breakfast option were a bit limited although the eggs benedict didn’t disappoint not too many food option immediately outside and around the hotel if you don’t anna be limited to the hotel restaurant,neg
i thought really long and hard to come up with any area where the hotel could improve only one thing comes to mind the location of the air conditioning unit in our room it was right beside the bed and it operated very loud it could disrupt sleep,neg
the location is far from everywhere so you either need to take a taxi or request the hotel scuttle which isn convenient,neg
there is a very limited number of places to eat around which becomes problematical particularly if one has dietary restrictions,neg
the was a persistent problem with the hot water in the shower and quite a strong smell of drainage,neg
too many camera in the room made people feel very uncomfortable the cleaner had no manners come in in the morning laughing and king half the time on their phone  no considerationnowhere to hang clothes,neg
had to change room there was nos desk or chair the bad was very hard,neg
the restaurant staff came across rude in every way  we tried to eat elsewhere most days,neg
the room was tucked away,neg
the pool was not child friendly and pleasant to use,neg
the king size bed is actually  twin beds pushed togetherroom floor was quite dusty elevator,neg
water in shower is very hard to control between hot and cold air condition engine is at the balcony not cool,neg
the bathroom was open air and that means no air so hot and also a lot of wildlife coming over the wall mosquitoes needles could be prevented if they installed a screen between the wall and sealing i do anna note that apparently outside bathroom are a thing here in thailand so maybe its just being european i just didn have peace of mind going to the bathroom at nighttime neighboring buildingshotels were a bid shabby but the atmosphere in taken compensated this nicely,neg
rooms to small,neg
air con only goes on once in room  if you like pool very busy and noisy with kiss  however they do have a garden pool with swim up bar that’s more relaxing  we prefer beach anyway,neg
no complaints at all,neg
the hotel location is a bit far from the center of lamp and for a family with infants it requires taking a taxi to every where getting out of the hotel by foot is not easy since the exit crosses with a fast roadalso the bed mattress was hard like stone but we didn ask to change it so i dont know if they could actually do something about it,neg
i didn enjoy the breakfast as much limited option i mostly just stuck with bacon and sausages as for location pro and sons it was a very quiet and private beach to enjoy but the distance from the airport and the fisherman village shopping and restaurant was very far out we spent  th to get there and back just for dinner,neg
the hotel is right beneath aeroplanes landing so can be noisy at times ark bar next door plays music until very late very loudly but in all fairness that not chewing garden beach resort,neg
very hard bed not comfortable at all😰,neg
too many stairs ll,neg
too far from everything,neg
the atmosphere at the bar and restaurant could have been better there was also a large unused space next to the restaurant with a few chairs spread around that did not add any value probably better if they had a pool table or something interesting there the to could have been placed better instead of stuffed in a corner given that we never watched to or even spent much time in the room it was not an inconvenience i also felt the breakfast lacked a little lymph,neg
noisy until early hours from music in other barsrooms quite small and no drawers only high shelling,neg
little bit old but great value,neg
maybe free hotel transportation from the airport or pier,neg
dark street staff not prepared to provide information as what to do in the city and recommendations,neg
inconsistent hot water in the shower a lot of times it was cold told to let it run for  minutes,neg
our only real complaint was that we booked a superior room with sea view yes we could see the sea but we were overlooking a roof from our balcony the main thing is the superior rooms back on to the road next to the hotel this road is busy and noisy and sometimes it was difficult to sleep if they could improve the soundproofing or even just put better fitting doors on those rooms it would help,neg
my recommendation is pay a little extra and get the better deluge rooms away from the road and which overlook the pool and restaurant area,neg
the bed is comfortable but the pillows are very high they should also provide lower pillows for us to choose the breakfast is a bit disappointing if more varieties would be better,neg
rooms tiny and mine was also lightness with no window except for bathroom which is ok for a  night stay,neg
we were asked to pay for the room wife,neg
the regular room is also good but it has some smell of moisture,neg
all was perfect,neg
pictures on webster dont reflect the actual specially condition of room furniture  bathroom,neg
noise from the airport nearby,neg
a lot of rooms were too far from the breakfast area and the walk back to the  room was very firing the golf car service was only available from the reception and not from the breakfast area the climb is too firing,neg
from the moment you checking there are signs everywhere about what you cannot do on property  this hotel must have had serious problems with hotel guests in the past but the signs make it so inviting and hospitable  this is not a joke “no popping in the bed no popping in the pool no make markings on the sheets no farming in the pool no jumping in the pool” etc etc  these signs are posted everywhere as well as potential fines  most ridiculous thing i have ever seen at an scale hotel  would never stay again,neg
the rooms need some cosmetic dating wife would be appreciated the staff could be more friendly and helpful the location is quite remote   minute walk to nearest shop so some basic items would be useful to buy at the hotel like cigarette lighter drinks fruit,neg
children running riot at breakfast,neg
they didn clean the room during our stay,neg
little far from chewing beach,neg
the hotel only offered expensive taxes but it seems to be a feature on oh same,neg
no issues,neg
the breakfast option could have improved its not a buffets rather they give you four option to choose from the air condition was not in a very good shape  the checking time was clot as apparently they didn know that i had a booking there and the guy had to call someone to check on the computer to see if i had a reservation after i showed them on my phone,neg
upon our arrival we were informed that the swimming pool was being cleaned so it would stay empty for the entirety of our stay needless to say this was really disappointing to us had we known about this we would have gone for any of the other many choice of residences nearby,neg
the only thing i can think of was that the bed was a little too firm for my liking but that subjective,neg
mosquitoes in the room got bitten,neg
wife rather louse breaks off frequently the room i was given is located in the annex building across the road this information should have been provided upon booking,neg
staff could be more friendly and helpful,neg
the wife is not always good,neg
no elevator but the staff is so kind to help youth residence has a restaurant too so sometimes there is smell of food bow not a big problem,neg
breakfast basic,neg
initially we got a smaller and cheaper room  needs renovation upbraiding want a problem the new room was updated spacious and light with a large bathroom pillows on the bed are enormous size not the best for the neckapart from that everything was great,neg
no breakfast included,neg
the bed were not comfortable at all the furniture are quite old and the bathroom smelt so bath therefore they use a plastic bag full of water to cover a smell tuning,neg
if travelling alone  the room is ok for one person or couples  to stay but for family especially there are kiss it maybe too small to stay,neg
our room had a leak due to strong downpour just before our arrival was quite a distance from the beach front,neg
bathroom bit smell even after clean maybe pipes,neg
nothing to dislike,neg
insects in the villa walk under the doors in to millpool is old and all the furniture is on it last legs breakfast very limited,neg
the administration staff were came across as miserable and seemed disinterested in checking me in and answering my questions  sadly felt like i was a bit of an inconvenience perhaps she was just having a bad day  understandable that happens,neg
however later that day i stood for what must have been almost  minutes waiting at the same empty reception before the general manager and what i assumed to be his entertainmentevents manager concluded what sounded like a very casual conversation less than  peters away from me before he finally decided to see what i neededonly to be told that the nature of my request had to be dealt with by the appropriate staff member and id have to wait until he returned or come back later nice,neg
apart from the beat waiter the lack of interest in service by the other members of staff is rather disheartening,neg
nothing really to dislike more european boutiques than authentic that,neg
expensive drinks late night noise,neg
rooms are ok could use some dating,neg
liked it all,neg
well if i have to say something some roads in the hotel are cliffs,neg
didn like there was a rat in my room outdoor shower was very run down ran out of water to have a shower  flush the toilet the resort needs clot of work we stayed here  years ago when it was q signature  i couldn fault it sad to say we wont come back to this resort,neg
do not book the offered day trip to the national park they claim there is snorkeling but there is not so disappointing not the hotels fault but be warned,neg
our unit was facing a disgusting ft security wall not even plastered and electrical wires hanging on the wall its from our front door not pleasant to sit on your deck   have coffee in the morning with no privacy from the units next to us  this disgusting wall in your face if you book please dont book a standard double standard room at smile house you will land up in what they call when you arrive the backward rooms we were stuck in what they call backward rooms at the back of the property the rooms were dark you had to put the lights on during the day we had been to smile house last september looked at the property  shown the rooms  that is why we decided to book  invite another couple because we loved the place not knowing about the backward rooms we booked in march for our september stay we are all in our sixties  travel at lot i have never complained about accommodation we have always been happy most times we  we book standard rooms never had a problem i am not a student i dont book cheap accommodationoffice staff one in particular when arrived should not be in hospitality,neg
service was the worst id ever experienced staff were the crudest people and we are very friendly people that get along with everyone,neg
the cost was expensive for what we got,neg
our room was quite warm the first two days like the air conditioned wasn’t working  also inconsistency w the towels  bath towels every day but hand towels only twice and washcloths only once,neg
there was no room service,neg
the breakfast was basic and poor with no varieties including that,neg
the bathroom has a hole in the wall where the extract fan was which meant bags could always get in so we had to lock the bathroom at all times our bathroom didn actually lock so we had to use our stuff to stop the door opening and move it whenever we needed to use the bathroom it  was also near the restaurant but smelled awful which really ruined the room a bit also the restaurant portions are really small for what you pay,neg
villas are a bit dated some little refurbished would do a great deal that the one and only thing i can consider slightly below expectations,neg
i stayed on the second floor and there is no lift but the staff were very helpful with that too  i was fully shown up when the that cleaning lady half my size carried my case down the stairs with ease,neg
no proper car park no mineral water for nd day onwards need to refill yourself by using the existing mineral bottle noisy till morning can sleep well,neg
service staffs are friendly but not professional you should expect to hear staffs speak with very rude words in that language as they thought that most of guests are foreigners and wont understand what they are saying moreover you should expect to be ignored when you eat at the beach front restaurant used plates cups and glasses are piled up at each table long before a service staff would come to collect them not every table would have the same dining utensils sometimes we got our food served but we had no folk or spoon to eat it and no water refilling culture at this restaurant,neg
you will have to call and wait for more than  minutes before someone would come to get your order we even gave up once and walked to eat at a local restaurant nearby which is providing far better service than this  stars hotel and no one even care when we walked out of the restaurant after waiting too long to order,neg
the taste of the food are not authentic that we understood that they might adjusted the taste of food to be more suitable for foreigners but it was not acceptable that a dish of expensive fried rice or fried nodules would be very wet like baby food we did tell the staff to give this note to their chess that at least they should not use wet rice to make fried rice like that its very sad but true to say that we agreed that we have far better service when we eat at shops like simpler or penza hut comparing to eating at this restaurant in an expensive  star hotel,neg
one more example is that the beach towels are not always available you have to be very lucky to have them we kept walking back to the towel shelf again and again to find that there is still no beach towels we see other guests are doing the same thing with us,neg
the wife is a bit annoying in that it keeps prompting for a login it would be nice if the hotel ever acknowledged loyalty as i said give stayed many many times but i never get any recognition or upgrade with so many hotels in chewing it would be good if your loyalty was rewarded in some way,neg
rooms was old but bathroom looks really nice,neg
the wife stopped working completely twice during my stay of two days it was down for a while when it worked it was also quite bad and slow the elevator stopped working one day the cleaner didn clean the coffee lungs she just put water in them and put them back on the plates it was clear to see since there was still old coffee marks in the coffee rugs with a little water inside as well as around on the plate they didn put new powder coffee bags in the rooms i had to go ask for it in the reception and then go up to the cleaning lady to get more instead of they delivering it at my room cleaner also didn clean the room properly as she leaves trash on the table instead of cleaning it up aircondition is very strange and hard to understand as it is a controlpanel on the wall with no signs of how to use it the staff couldn show me how it worked before hours later after i asked one of the lady in the reception always had a sure on her face when i was trying to tell heather about something that was wrong the bathroom had a smell of humidity the reception and the cleaning lady is asking if you check out in an unpleasant way about an hour before check out time the reception lady also stares at you obviously and talk to each other while laughing i dont think this place was worth the money it was not too comfortable to stay here and i believe for that the same price you can get other nicer rooms to stay in elsewhere,neg
may be the beachfront that time we went it might not be that fabulous but it did not bothering us at all,neg
staff watched films most days with the volume very high,neg
bit dark could do with more light in the bathroom,neg
worse value for money ever the location is pretty bad there nothing within a walking distancethe room itself was kind old design which is cool but the bed was horrible and squeaking we couldn sleep all night wanted to have a bath but it was dirty the hot water in shower was inconsistent honestly this hotel is way over prices and over rate,neg
the hard mattress,neg
breakfast was  goodby it  was not much fresh fruit  this resort is not super close to shopping or the city centreneed a taxi  the walk outside of the hotel area is not pleasant you are walking with car trafficprices sea  center and  transfer to the airport like  london,neg
the roomsbalconies could and should be cleaner and better maintained little things like light bulb had blown and not been replaced,neg
grm could be improved,neg
swimming pool beds are close to each other round the pool lacking privacy,neg
we didn feel comfortable at all here staff was unfriendly room simple we couldn close the door properly wife didn work properly food was ok but too expensive and the situation want satisfying either you walk  minutes to a wonderful beach  but there is nothing else the two restaurant nearby were closed so early that we couldn even grab dinner there anymore at pm,neg
ok  there were issues here and i’d be cautious booking with them again  when we arrived we were ‘upgrade’ to their sister hotel with no real explanation as to why  something about a credit card not clearing but then it cleared immediately when we paid on the spot  the sister hotel was nice and an upgrade for two days into a very plush villa  but then we were asked to move rooms within that hotel for one day we got some compensation after we argued in that we were offered free sea’s dinner and airport transfer which were nice but the move meant packing up again and losing  hours of the day as the new rooms were not ready of course when we were then transferred to the original hotel we booked we were put in a room near a very noisy generation  we complained again and they turned the generation off  this complaint saw me finally lose my temper with the staff which is most unlike me  we got the distinct impression from one member of staff that they have a policy of over booking the hotel and moving people around into spare rooms in their sister hotel the other side of the island,neg
as always the that people are lovely and very apologetic but when you have traveled that far from the up for that cost to be moved around so much is not at all on  i don’t expect to have to get into challenging conversations with people while on holiday  that’s what work is for,neg
also watch out for the bug spraying they do every other day  burns your eyes  that can’t be right can it,neg
in summary it’s an amazing hotel and resort  the architects and builders did a great job  the management  not so much,neg
a wired pool structure  small pools just behind the main building you can’t see the beach from the pool just the other hotel rooms,neg
mediumunattractive facilitiesbad food quality at breakfastbeds way too shortslow wife,neg
the drinks  food are expensive for that standards but they have a happy hour where its  drinks for  some staff members seemed a bit unbothered while others were very friendly and welcoming,neg
the pool generally beautiful however chemically needs better control very irritating on the eyes,neg
needs a kiss menu as in all other things it’s a great place for children,neg
the apartments are on the top of a hill so its quite uncomfy to get to the apartment but with sooner there is no problem at allthere was always problem with closing the door of the apartment,neg
the only negative point was jets staff very rude and professional,neg
too many rules i got shouted at just for getting water on the leather couch saying if i damage it id have to replace it which i thought was so rude considering it was just drop of water from my drink,neg
poor overall condition and lack of maintenance,neg
not much the reason why i went to another hotel once my family joined was the lack of a kidsclub but plenty of kiss there anyway so there is someone to play with usually,neg
the t v channels were limited the board walk needs to be reviewed as needs some fixing up eg nails some of the breakfast eg bake beans need to be hot,neg
the toilet has authentic but glass doors that dont really close so there is no noise block,neg
expensive on drinks so many guests opt to go elsewhere for a drinkhotels in same generally lack approach to keep guests in the hotels come from an island with beach hotels so sharing experience,neg
nothing our stay was perfect,neg
just a shame the part of the hotel on the beach side was undergoing renovation but will look spectacular when finished,neg
main pool was dirty guessing due to verse by the many children at this resort,neg
bags in the room,neg
run down and obviously not well maintained,neg
food was a little bit expensive,neg
price of taxes,neg
check in and check out took too long,neg
communication with staffs difficult as they dont speak or understand english,neg
no privacy although my booking was for private two bedrooms villa,neg
only one restaurant in the hotel,neg
only one bathroom in two bedrooms villa,neg
access to the property is difficult and it is dangerous to walk outside the property,neg
the location sucks and the resort grounds are renown and old,neg
we booked a twin room when we were shown the room it was very small and the  beds were pushed together there was no balcony or outside window there was barely room to walk around the beds the upgrade we were offered we had to pay for this was a double room  we were  friends travelling together not a couple the hotel receptions could not understand why we saw this as problem eventually we agreed to take the room because it was late and we didn want to scour bout for a twin room we later discovered there was a pull out single bed under the double bed why were we not shown this,neg
the breakfast selection can be improved,neg
expensive food menu pool not that big,neg
bed was a little hard but not so bad that i didn get a great nights sleep,neg
the reception staff were frosty the lock on our door was broken and they moved us to an unfinished dirty room only when i complained did they move us to a better room the upgrade room was great though and very spacious the pool area was overrun with large family groups from very early morning until late at night the staff could not control them they were loud rude and disruption for people eating in the restaurant they would also reserve sun beds with towels even when not in use so nobody could take them the pool area needs to be renovated the sun beds are broken and need to be varnished or painted the grounds of the hotel and garden are beautiful,neg
occasional sound disturbance at night from the elephant and ark beach bars,neg
the curtains were pretty useless in our room we got women up at  every morning by the intense light coming into the room and our ac unit was not so new it was pretty noisy at times these were our only issues with the whole place,neg
door security seems flies although had no security issues maybe more sun beds,neg
all prices in the hotel are excluding  service charge and  vat door of shower wasn’t able to closefitness rather tinted a bit quickly,neg
it was perfect,neg
a bit price,neg
some room equipment coffee machine bathrobes was a little tired overpriced sea,neg
a little prices for what you get,neg
the beach,neg
the people were hot,pos
the food was hot when served,pos
