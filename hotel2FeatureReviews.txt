expensive food and drinks
restaurant prices were a bit expensive
expensive drinks late night noise
good location cheap room rate
we loved the privacy the pool was always warm which was amazing
in the two bedroom pool villa the bedrooms bathroom and the furniture in all living spaces was horrible
they gave us a free dinner voucher free transportation to the airport and a bottle of sparkling wine
pantry maybe have not been touched for a couple of days disgusting looking lunch meats nobody touched them some fruits dirty table mats and dirty food rays and plastic container we wanted to check out as early as possible and get a refund
its so close to the beach yet the place was kept clean n tidy from beach sands
free room upgrade comfortable and clean great location staff and beach parties
beautiful rooms and resort amazing beach very clean good location
the hotel is located right on the beach the beach is perfect clean sand and blue water
great staff great atmosphere and fantastic facilities the staff bent over backwards to help
the beds were very hard the staff were good though and put an extra due underneath to help
the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff were so friendly and happy to help 
amazing view and really friendly people you have any questions you can just ask them and they will help youalso renting a sooner at the hotel is really easy
expensive food and drinks
i did find the food and drinks more expensive here than surrounding restaurant and bars
ark bar is the place to be in same  the beach great staff great food for a fair price nice party with good music just a chill place to stay  same
great staff great taste food very good location all major clubs and bars are near it’s noisy but only till  am
clean and good location
excellent value hotel is straight on the beach it has  pools and restaurant on the beach with very reasonable prices there is an awesome night
ideal location excellent staff and very clean
its so close to the beach yet the place was kept clean n tidy from beach sands
i booked from booking and i paid with my credit card and when i went for choking in the woman in the reception said ok sir you confirmed your booking and you already paid but we need you credit card to take photo i show her my credit card with my name and my passport
checkintaking full payment for the entire stay at checking and an additional £ hold on your card for potential room expenses which they don’t release for days after you leave
because we forgot the credit card we booked and paid with back in april there was an issue at check in they refused the original card and charged us on one of the cards we had with us so we lost out on the exchange rate and bank charges
you can get better hotels for the same money
the downsides of this place is how loud it is so if you want quiet then request a room away from the pool sometimes the bed sheets and towels weren’t clean one of the women on reception is also very rude all the other staff are great but she is helpful didn’t want to help us when drunk people were banging on our door at am and non stop waking us up
fantastic place so quiet and pictures
peace and quiet
the beach is quiet and beautiful and the price for the room is ok
very well trained staff and excellent service  precise and professional
ideal location excellent staff and very clean
staff very friendly and helpful  great location for relaxing and nighttime  massage on beach excellent
clean staff friendliness and location just perfectly beach front
swimming pool is nice with its view
view is amazing
service and food were amazing loved the view from my room as well as from the pool
loved the colonial style layout everything was very clean  it is situated on a lovely quiet beach it almost feels as though you have a private beach
the wifi was a joke not to that the password changed every two days
wifi was very bad
internet was not good
wifi could have been better small but very nice and cool pool
